Business needs
Add 500€ mrr before end of December
Available assets:
- Duomo design - exsisting client, potential upsell -> blog articles (I am setting up a n8n automation with a code I got on reddit - it can be used to sell articles generally speaking)
- lead gen crash course academy with 30 students -> 1 hour crash course on lead gen with all my agency template -> all available on notion + online school (needs extra setup)
	- we can use the exsisting content I have to produce articles and generate inbound
	- agency site stratega.co needs maintainance and we need to update it and connect it with the school (uteach.io/stratega)
- I have a lot of frameworks and tempaltes around we can create other courses
- A guide I'd love to create is how I set you up
- chatty insights -> investor & advisor & they are clients - we can upsell - you need more info on this
- my linkedin network must be exploited (around 5k connections, mostly on target)
Marketing / ops:
- fix website (we have Toma, my va who can also help but i'd love to create an ai agent that takes care of it)
- create more content
- back on posting on linkedin but would love to explore more
- you need to push me to buiild in public

Extras:
I have a huge passion for tools, I own around 50 ltd licenses and built a database about it that we can refresh..

there is a lot of potential here, we need to exploit it


Answers
1. Duomo hard to sell but we'll try
2. I want to use the school, don't like gumroad idea but we can sell templates on the school platform
3. linkedin audit nah, not scalable.. if we create a saas around it then yes, but if we have to do so it has to be worthwile (we can explore)
4. not doing lead gen anymore. i am learning n8n and i have a lot of valuable codes we can use to get clients and create content. I want to do more demand gen and abm rather than outbound (keen on doing this to promote the school tho)
5. I need to give you access to the school content and eventually my n8n codes
