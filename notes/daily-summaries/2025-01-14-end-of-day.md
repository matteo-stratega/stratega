# End of Day Summary - January 14, 2025

## Completed Today ✅
- **Installed Claude Code + setup complete** - From zero terminal experience to fully operational
- **Installed GEMINI integration** - Multi-AI collaboration ready
- **Created Stratega OS folder structure** - Proper organization following CLAUDE.md philosophy
- **Built Session Closer agent** - Daily workflow system for clean handoffs
- **Ran initial agent tests** - Validated setup works

**🎉 MAJOR WIN:** Went from never opening terminal 2 weeks ago to building AI agent infrastructure today!

## In Progress 🔄
| Task | Status | Blocker | Next Action |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Content Creator Agent | 30% | Needs videos/transcriptions | Share content materials Monday morning |
| Drive Stratega Reorganization | 0% | Not started | Review current structure Monday, plan cleanup |
| GitHub + MCP Setup | 0% | Not started | Initialize git repo for agents, configure MCP |
| Testing Plan Outline | 0% | Waiting on clean setup | Schedule planning session after infrastructure ready |

## Decisions Made 🎯
- **Full Drive Stratega reorganization required:** Current structure needs cleanup before building more
- **Doc review process:** Matteo reviews all outputs before finalizing
- **Delegation model that works:** Provide examples + input, then give autonomy to execute
- **Clean setup first, then scale:** No launching new things until foundation is solid
- **Monday cold start:** No weekend prep needed, fresh start Monday morning

## Blockers & Issues ⚠️
