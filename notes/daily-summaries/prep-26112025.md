# Daily Prep: 26 November 2025

## Start Here

**CRITICAL: Restart Claude Code FIRST** - MCP won't work until restart.

After restart, verify MCP integration:
1. Check if MCP tools are available
2. Test n8n workflow listing
3. Confirm API connection

Then open: `/docs/N8N_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` for workflow documentation.

## Today's Top 3 Priorities

1. **Riorganizzazione drive e docs** - 30% fatto ieri, continuare con:
   - Google Sheets links consolidation
   - Duplicate file removal
   - Archive historical client folders
   - Target: 60-70% complete by end of day

2. **N8n workflows: Test via MCP + Create Telegram bot**
   - Test MCP workflow commands (list, execute, create)
   - Review existing 4 workflows
   - Create Telegram notification bot
   - Connect bot to campaign triggers

3. **Campaign copy flow: Read scoring docs + Create DM sequence**
   - Review `/research/icp-analysis/game-theory-scoring-model.md`
   - Analyze top 150 prospects (50 founders, 50 marketers, 50 operators)
   - Create personalized DM sequences per segment
   - Plan campaign tools (LinkedIn, Telegram bot, tracking)

## Context From Yesterday

### Session 1: Notion + Lead Gen Crash Course
- Organized Lead Gen Crash Course (12K words, 5 modules)
- Monetization plan: €500 MRR target
- Voice analysis for Content Engine

### Session 2: ICP Scoring System
- Game theory ICP scoring model built
- 4,716 LinkedIn connections scored
- Top 150 prospects extracted (avg score: 82.0)
- Expected: 12-18 conversions → €588-882 MRR

### Session 3: Drive Cleanup + n8n MCP
- Drive reorganization: 30% complete (200+ files)
- CSV reduction: 66% (169→58 files)
- n8n Docker running + API configured
- MCP installed (not tested - requires restart)
- 6 documentation files created

## Watch Out For

1. **MCP restart required** - Claude Code MUST be restarted before MCP works
2. **Token efficiency** - Follow SESSION_START.md (max 600 tokens startup)
3. **Drive cleanup scope** - 70% still remaining, don't get stuck
4. **Campaign data ready** - Top 150 prospects waiting for outreach sequences
5. **n8n workflows** - 4 existing workflows may need updates/testing

## Files to Open

### Essential
1. `/docs/N8N_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - n8n setup and workflow docs
2. `/research/icp-analysis/game-theory-scoring-model.md` - ICP scoring methodology
3. `/data/lead-lists/top-150-prospects.csv` - Campaign targets
4. `/docs/ARCHIVISTA_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Drive cleanup status

### Reference
5. `/SESSION_START.md` - Token optimization protocol
6. `/agents/stratega-brain.md` - Core operating instructions
7. `/GEMINI.md` - Project-wide configuration

## Quick Wins Available

- Test MCP n8n integration (5 min)
- Create Telegram bot basic setup (15 min)
- Archive 5-10 old client folders (10 min)
- Draft first DM sequence for founders segment (20 min)

## Infrastructure Status

✅ **Data warehouse** - Organized, indexed, ready
✅ **n8n** - Running, API connected, MCP configured
✅ **ICP scoring** - Complete, top 150 extracted
⚠️ **MCP** - Installed but not tested (restart required)
🔄 **Drive cleanup** - 30% done, 70% remaining
⏳ **Campaign** - Data ready, sequences pending

## Expected Outcomes Today

1. Drive cleanup: 60-70% complete
2. MCP + n8n: Tested and working
3. Telegram bot: Created and connected
4. Campaign sequences: First drafts for 3 segments
5. Ready to launch: Campaign execution plan finalized
