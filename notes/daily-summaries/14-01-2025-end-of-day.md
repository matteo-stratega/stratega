| ----------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Creator Agent         | 30%    | Needs videos/transcriptions | Share content materials Monday morning               |

## Decisions Made 🎯
- **Full Drive Stratega reorganization required:** Current structure needs cleanup before building more
- **Doc review process:** Matteo reviews all outputs before finalizing
- **Delegation model that works:** Provide examples + input, then give autonomy to execute
- **Clean setup first, then scale:** No launching new things until foundation is solid
- **Monday cold start:** No weekend prep needed, fresh start Monday morning
- **Date format preference:** DD-MM-YYYY for all dated files (European format)
- **Obsidian organization principle:** Daily logs separate from agent definitions; agents folder for scalability
- **Quality over speed:** Values getting structure right before building more

## Blockers & Issues ⚠️
**None** - Clear path forward

## Key Files & Outputs 📁
**Created:**

- Obsidian vault structure: `_admin/`, `agents/`, `daily-notes/`, `assets/`

**Attempted (not finalized):**
