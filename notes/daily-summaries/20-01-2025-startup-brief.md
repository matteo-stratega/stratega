# Monday Morning Startup Brief - 20 January 2025

## Start Here 👇
**First thing to do:** Review current Drive Stratega folder structure and create reorganization plan

## Today's Top 3 Priorities

1. **Drive Stratega Reorganization**
   - Why it matters: Clean foundation before building more systems
   - Success = Clear folder structure that matches Stratega OS philosophy
   - First step: Open Drive Stratega, audit current structure, identify what needs to move

2. **GitHub + MCP Setup for Agent Management**
   - Why it matters: Proper version control and connection infrastructure for scaling
   - Success = Agents under version control, MCP connected and working
   - First step: Initialize git repo in `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/agents/`

3. **Finalize Content Creator Agent**
   - Why it matters: Need world-class content creation system based on your actual methodology
   - Success = Content creator agent trained on your videos/transcriptions and ready to use
   - First step: Share videos/transcriptions with Claude, refine agent with real examples

## Context From Last Week
- **Completed:** Installed Claude Code + GEMINI, created folder structure, built session-closer agent, organized Obsidian vault
- **In Progress:** Content creator agent (needs your content), infrastructure setup
- **Key Decision:** Clean setup first, then scale - no launching new things until foundation is solid
- **New:** Obsidian vault now organized with _admin/, agents/, daily-notes/, assets/ structure

## Your Organized Systems 📁
- **Stratega Repo:** `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/`
- **Obsidian Vault:** `/Users/matteolombardi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/`
  - Daily summaries in: `daily-notes/`
  - Agents in: `agents/`
  - Brain docs in: `_admin/`

## Watch Out For ⚠️
- Drive Stratega may be messier than expected - budget time for reorganization
- MCP setup might have technical steps - don't rush it
- Reference the newly organized Obsidian vault structure as a model for Drive Stratega

## Files to Open
- `/Users/matteolombardi/Drive Stratega/` - for reorganization planning
- `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/CLAUDE.md` - reference for folder philosophy
- `/Users/matteolombardi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/_admin/stratega-brain.md` - your core brain definition

## After Clean Setup
Once foundation is solid: Planning session for all the testing priorities you want to outline

---
*You've got this. Start with Drive Stratega reorganization - clean workspace, clean mind.*
