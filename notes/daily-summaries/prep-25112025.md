# Morning Startup Brief - 25 November 2025

## Start Here 👇
**First thing to do:** Delegate to Archivista agent to analyze Drive + docs structure and recommend cleanup

## Today's Top 3 Priorities

### 1. Drive & Docs Reorganization
- **Why it matters:** Current structure is messy - need clean foundation
- **Success = 30% reorganization complete**
- **First step:** Launch Archivista (file-classifier-organizer) to:
  - Analyze `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/` folder structure
  - Identify removable files (since we have Google Drive symlink active)
  - Check docs synced to Obsidian + GitHub (keep only relevant ones)
  - Recommend cleanup plan

**Key Question to Resolve:** Can we remove files from `/AI-Projects/stratega/` given:
- Active symlink to Google Drive
- Docs synced to Obsidian
- Docs synced to GitHub
- We don't want duplicates, only relevant ones

### 2. N8N Setup & Workflow Testing
- **Why it matters:** Test, build confidence, monetizable potential
- **Success = 1 working flow**
- **First step:** Review imported n8n workflows and figure out how to make Claude work with them

**Context from yesterday:**
- n8n workflows uploaded by Gemini
- Organized in repo structure
- Not tested yet

**Files to reference:**
- `/docs/SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - n8n structure
- n8n workflows folder (wherever organized yesterday)

### 3. Prospect Selection Algorithm Analysis + Campaign Copy Flow
- **Why it matters:** First step toward Sprint 1 execution
- **Success = Campaign plan with operational actions and tool connections**
- **First step:** Read scoring docs and create campaign execution plan

**Files to read:**
- `/docs/ICP_SCORING_FRAMEWORK.md` - How the model works
- `/docs/GROWTH_SPRINT_STRATEGY.md` - Campaign strategy
- `/outputs/linkedin_scoring/SCORING_RESULTS.md` - The 150 scored contacts

**Output needed:**
- Campaign copy flow (DM sequence)
- Operational actions list (what we need to do)
- Tool connections needed (what to connect for execution)

## Context From Yesterday

**Major Wins:**
- ICP scoring system complete (4,716 connections analyzed)
- Top 150 contacts extracted and segmented
- Lead Gen Crash Course organized (12K words)
- Token optimization fixed (48K vs 110K previous session)

**Ready to use:**
- Top 50 founders (avg score 82.0) - Week 1 campaign
- Top 50 agency (avg score 72.0) - Week 2 campaign
- Top 50 corporate (avg score 67.0) - Week 3+ campaign

**In Progress:**
- Voice profile analysis (waiting on slides + transcript)
- Database School access (30 students - not accessible yet)
- Agent updates with new context

## Your Organized Systems 📁

**Main repo:** `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/matteo-stratega/stratega
**Obsidian:** Synced with docs
**Google Drive:** Symlinked (needs cleanup analysis)

## Watch Out For ⚠️

- **Symlink complexity:** Be careful with file operations - check before deleting
- **n8n workflows:** May need technical setup/configuration
- **Token budget:** Stick to SESSION_START.md protocol (max 600 tokens startup)

## Files to Open

**Priority 1 (Drive cleanup):**
- Current structure: `/Users/matteolombardi/AI-Projects/stratega/`
- Google Drive structure (to compare)
- Obsidian vault structure (to compare)

**Priority 2 (n8n):**
- `/docs/SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
- n8n workflows folder

**Priority 3 (Campaign):**
- `/docs/ICP_SCORING_FRAMEWORK.md`
- `/docs/GROWTH_SPRINT_STRATEGY.md`
- `/outputs/linkedin_scoring/SCORING_RESULTS.md`

## Execution Strategy

**For Priority 1:** Use Task tool with `subagent_type: file-classifier-organizer` (Archivista)
**For Priority 2:** Direct exploration + testing (may need Archimede if coding required)
**For Priority 3:** Direct analysis + strategic planning (Metis handles this)

## Expected Outcomes Today

- **Drive cleanup plan** with safe file removal recommendations
- **1 n8n flow working** and documented
- **Campaign execution plan** with copy flow, actions, and tool requirements
- **Token usage under 40K** (yesterday was 48K - let's optimize further)
