## In Progress

Nothing - all tasks completed for today.

## Decisions Made

1. **SESSION_START.md protocol** - Max 600 tokens startup (vs 8K yesterday)
2. **Hybrid cleanup approach** - Quick wins first (CSV consolidation)
3. **enhanced-n8n-mcp-server** - Chosen for advanced workflow features
4. **Campaign planning deferred** - Infrastructure prioritized today
5. **ICP scoring methodology** - Game theory framework for lead qualification

## Blockers

None currently.

## Mental Clarity

### What Went Well
- Token optimization working (SESSION_START.md = huge win)
- Infrastructure now solid: data organized, n8n running, MCP configured
- Three distinct sessions, all productive
- ICP scoring = actionable campaign data ready

### What to Improve
- MCP requires Claude Code restart tomorrow (not tested yet)
- Drive cleanup still 70% to go (200+ files remaining)
- Campaign execution still pending (need DM sequences)

### Energy Level
High. Infrastructure complete, ready for campaign execution tomorrow.
