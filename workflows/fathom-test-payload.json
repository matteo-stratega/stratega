  "transcript": "Matteo: Good afternoon everyone. Let's start with our weekly growth review. Sarah, can you give us an update on the LinkedIn ICP scoring project? Sarah: Sure. So we've completed the implementation of the scoring framework. We processed over 500 profiles yesterday and the accuracy looks really good. About 85% match rate with our manual validation. Matteo: That's excellent progress. What's the plan for scaling this? Sarah: I think we should run it on the full database. It'll take about 6 hours to process everything. David, can you help with the infrastructure monitoring? David: Absolutely. I'll set up the monitoring dashboard today. I can also implement the retry logic in case any API calls fail. Matteo: Perfect. What about the Notion integration? Sarah: That's next on my list. I want to get the scoring stable first, then we'll pipe all the results into Notion for the sales team. Should be done by Friday. David: I've been looking at the n8n workflows. We could automate the entire pipeline - from scraping to scoring to Notion. Would save hours per week. Matteo: I love it. Let's make that the priority for next week. Any blockers? Sarah: No blockers on my side. The Anthropic API has been super reliable. David: Same here. All systems running smoothly. Matteo: Great. One more thing - let's start tracking our cost per lead. I want to see the ROI on these AI tools. David: I can add that to the analytics dashboard. Should be straightforward. Matteo: Perfect. Let's aim to have everything production-ready by end of week. Any questions? Sarah: Nope, I'm clear on next steps. David: All good here. Matteo: Excellent meeting everyone. Let's sync again on Thursday to review progress. Thanks team!",
