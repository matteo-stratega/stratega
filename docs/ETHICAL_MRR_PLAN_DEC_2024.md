## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Learning-First Revenue

This isn't about aggressive scaling. It's about **survival + learning while building ethically.**

### Principles
1. **Build things you need to learn anyway** (n8n, automation, micro-SaaS)
2. **Document the learning journey** (build in public = marketing)
3. **Create products from what you learn** (courses, templates, tools)
4. **Charge fairly for real value** (help people, don't extract)
5. **€500/month is enough** (survival first, scaling later)

### Non-Negotiables
- No aggressive sales tactics
- No gatekeeping knowledge
- No overselling or false promises
- Transparent about "why" you're charging (survival + time investment)
- Real value delivery always comes first

## 🏫 Stratega School: The Ethical Value Ladder

### Current Assets
- **30 students** who already trust you (massive validation)
- Lead gen crash course content (ready)
- All templates on Notion
- Hosted on uteach.io/stratega
- Strong relationship foundation

### The Ethical Structure

#### **Free Tier** (Lead Magnet)
- Core frameworks available
- Introduction modules
- Community access (Discord/Slack)
- **Value:** Enough to get real results, not everything

#### **Paid Tier** - "Growth Operator Academy" (€49/month or €299 one-time)
**What's included:**
- Full course access (all modules)
- Templates + SOPs (Notion + downloadable)
- Live monthly Q&A calls (1 hour/month)
- Private community with active participation
- n8n automation templates (built in real-time)
- Case studies + walkthroughs as you learn
- Behind-the-scenes of building micro-SaaS

**The ethical positioning:**
*"I'm learning n8n and building automation templates in real-time. Paid members get everything I build + monthly calls where I show you exactly how it works. We're learning together."*

### Expected Conversion
- **Conservative:** 5-10 of 30 students = €245-490/month
- **Optimistic:** 10-15 of 30 students = €490-735/month
- **Target:** 10 students = **€490 MRR** (98% of €500 goal with ONE stream)

## 🧭 The Ethical Sales Framework

### Email Template to 30 Students

**Subject:** Building the Growth Operator Academy - join me?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick update on Stratega School.

Over the next 3 months, I'm learning n8n, Supabase, and building
micro-SaaS products from scratch. I'm documenting everything and
sharing it in real-time with paid academy members.

Here's what's included:

✅ All course modules + templates
✅ Every automation I build (n8n workflows, lead enrichment,
   content distribution)
✅ Monthly live calls where I show you exactly what I'm building
✅ Private community where we learn together

I'm charging €49/month (or €299 one-time) because this takes time
and I need to keep the lights on. But I promise you'll get more
value than you pay for.

If you want to learn growth, automation, and indie hacking alongside
me, join here: [link]

If not, no worries - free tier stays free and you'll still get value.

Matteo
```

**Why This Works Ethically:**
- ✅ Transparent about why you're charging (survival)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (learning together)
- ✅ No pressure (free tier remains)
- ✅ Honest about what they get
- ✅ Positions you as fellow learner, not guru

## 🛡️ Protecting Your Learning Time

### The PickEat Reality Check

**Current situation:** 10h/week to PickEat, €0 return

**The truth:** If PickEat generates €0 and prevents you from hitting €1,339 MRR, PickEat is actively hurting your survival.

### Options:

**Option 1: Reduce to 5h/week**
- Bare minimum to not abandon it
- Frees up 5h/week for Stratega (25h total)

**Option 2: Negotiate Equity**
- If giving 10h/week free, you should own meaningful %
- Formalize relationship or reduce commitment

**Option 3: Set Deadline**
- "If PickEat doesn't generate revenue by March 2025, I reduce to 2h/week"
- Clear boundary for your financial health

### Recommendation:
**5h/week max for PickEat until you hit €2K MRR.**

You can't learn n8n, build products, AND give PickEat 10h/week without burning out again.

## 🧠 Mindset for Success

### Remember:
- **You're not selling, you're inviting people to learn with you**
- **€500/month = survival, not greed**

- **PickEat nearly broke you - Stratega is your recovery**
- **Learning while earning = double win**
- **No fields. We make this work.**

### The Goal Is Not:

- ❌ Building an empire in 5 weeks

### The Goal Is:
- ✅ Survival with dignity
- ✅ Learning valuable skills (n8n, SaaS, indie hacking)
- ✅ Helping others while helping yourself
- ✅ Building sustainable, ethical revenue
- ✅ Creating space to breathe after PickEat burnout
