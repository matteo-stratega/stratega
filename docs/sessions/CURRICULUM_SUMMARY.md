## 💡 Learning Strategy

**Not academic study. Real building.**

1. **Learn just-in-time** - Study when you need it for project
2. **Build with AI** - Use Claude/ChatGPT as pair programmer
3. **Start simple** - Get working version, then improve
4. **Ship often** - Commit daily, deploy weekly
5. **Real problems** - Only work on Stratega needs

**Time commitment:** 5-7 hours/week
**Duration:** 90 days
**Outcome:** Technical autonomy

---

## 🎓 The Files (Read These)

**Start here:**
1. `/docs/TECHNICAL_SKILL_ASSESSMENT.md` - Understand where you are
2. `/docs/LEARNING_ROADMAP_90_DAYS.md` - Week-by-week plan

**Reference daily:**
3. `/docs/guides/javascript-for-n8n.md` - Copy-paste snippets
4. `/docs/guides/python-for-automation.md` - Script templates

**When building:**
5. `/docs/TECHNICAL_PROJECTS.md` - Project specifications
6. `/docs/TECHNICAL_CURRICULUM.md` - Full curriculum

**Operations:**
7. `/docs/guides/docker-quick-start.md` - Docker commands
8. `/docs/guides/git-workflow.md` - Git best practices

## 🔥 The Reality Check

**This is NOT:**
- ❌ A comprehensive CS degree
- ❌ Everything there is to know
- ❌ Academic theoretical knowledge

**This IS:**
- ✅ What you need for Stratega autonomy
- ✅ Practical skills you'll use daily
- ✅ ROI-optimized learning path

**You won't become a senior developer.**
**You will become technically autonomous.**

That's the goal.

---

## 🎯 Your Starting Point

**This week:**
1. Read `/docs/LEARNING_ROADMAP_90_DAYS.md` (Week 1 section)
2. Open `/docs/guides/javascript-for-n8n.md`
3. Build Project 1: JSON Cleaner Node
4. Commit to Git: "feat: add JSON cleaner node"

**Next week:**
- Review Week 1 success criteria
- Start Week 2 (JavaScript async patterns)
- Build Project 2 (CSV Deduplicator)

**Keep going:**
- Follow the 90-day roadmap
- Build all 15 projects
- Ship tools to production
- Become autonomous

---

## 💎 Bottom Line

**You have everything you need to become technically autonomous in 90 days.**

The curriculum is ready.
The projects are defined.
The path is clear.

All that's left:
**Start.**
