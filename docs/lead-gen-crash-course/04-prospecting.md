# **Module 4: Prospecting**

**Video 1: Evaluating Databases for Prospecting**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Overview of Popular Databases**

•	**LinkedIn Standard Search**: Often considered the default tool for finding prospects, but it has limitations.

•	**Issue**: Poor filtering options, manual searches, and irrelevant results make it hard to narrow down a targeted list.

•	**Sales Navigator**: Offers more advanced search and filtering capabilities, but still has limitations.

•	**Issue**: The database is not well formatted, with inconsistent or outdated data.

•	**Outreach Databases**: Static and often don’t capture dynamic changes in a prospect’s career or status.

•	**Issue**: Too static; limited ability to update in real time, leading to inaccurate lists.

2.	**Benefits and Advantages of Scraping**

•	Scraping allows for dynamic, customizable searches that can be tailored to your ICP’s specific attributes.

•	**Example**: You can scrape LinkedIn profiles, events, or posts to create a list that’s more accurate and tailored than databases provide.

•	**Advantage**: With scraping, you can search using industry-specific keywords, events, or affiliations, ensuring your list is always up to date.

3.	**Best Practices for Scraping**

•	**Tools for Scraping**: Use tools like **PhantomBuster**, **Scrapy**, or **Octoparse** to scrape LinkedIn profiles or public web data.

•	**Example**: Scrape posts from LinkedIn based on keywords like “founder” or “SaaS” to find prospects in real time.

•	**Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Always ensure your scraping methods comply with the platform’s terms of service.

**Video 2: Digital Touchpoints and Refining Your ICP**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**What are Digital Touchpoints?**

•	Digital touchpoints are the online activities, platforms, and interactions where your ICP spends their time.

•	**Example**: A founder interested in Y Combinator is likely following Y Combinator on LinkedIn, reading their blog, or attending their events.

2.	**Using Digital Touchpoints to Refine Your ICP**

•	By identifying where your ICP spends their digital time, you can fine-tune your targeting.

•	**Example**: Scraping posts with the keyword “founder” on LinkedIn and narrowing it down by filtering the people who follow Y Combinator’s page, giving you a highly targeted audience of startup founders.

3.	**How Digital Touchpoints Lead to Better Targeting**

•	Follow industry pages, events, and hashtags that align with your ICP’s interests to gather relevant data and build campaigns.

•	**Example**: You can scrape event attendees or post commenters on LinkedIn who interact with relevant content like startup accelerators or SaaS conferences.

4.	**Automation Using Digital Touchpoints**

•	Setting up automated scraping and enrichment workflows based on touchpoints ensures your lists are always updated.

•	**Example**: Automate a search that scrapes LinkedIn event attendees tagged with specific keywords like “growth marketing” or “SaaS,” then feed that into your lead gen workflow.

**Video 3: Database Limitations and Tuning for Accuracy**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Database Limitations**

•	Each database (LinkedIn, Sales Navigator, Outreach, etc.) has inherent limitations that require adjustment and tuning to work effectively.

•	**LinkedIn Standard Search**: Too broad, difficult to fine-tune results for specific ICP attributes.

•	**Sales Navigator**: Good for segmentation, but data can be outdated or inaccurate.

•	**Outreach Database**: Stale data; lacks real-time updates on prospect movements or new hires.

2.	**Tuning Databases for Better Results**

•	**LinkedIn**: Use advanced filters, Boolean searches, and LinkedIn groups or events to find more targeted prospects.

•	**Example**: Boolean search “Founder AND SaaS AND ‘Marketing Automation’” to filter down relevant leads.

•	**Sales Navigator**: Use custom lists and real-time alerts for job changes or new company roles to stay up to date.

•	**Example**: Set alerts for when a “VP of Marketing” switches to a new company, as they may be more open to new solutions.

3.	**Scraping as a Dynamic Alternative**

•	Scraping enables you to capture real-time data from digital touchpoints like blog comments, event attendees, or social media interactions, providing a more accurate and updated list.

•	**Example**: Scrape attendees of a LinkedIn event titled “Scaling SaaS Companies” to gather a list of founders and growth marketers.

**Video 4: Email Enrichment and Providers**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Why Email Enrichment is Crucial**

•	Enrichment helps you complete missing data, such as email addresses, company details, or job titles, for more complete outreach.

•	**Example**: After scraping a list of founders from LinkedIn, use enrichment to gather email addresses, company sizes, or other relevant data.

2.	**Top Email Enrichment Providers**

•	**Clearbit**: Enriches contacts with firmographic data (company size, industry, revenue).

•	**Hunter.io**: Helps find verified email addresses based on domain and public data.

•	**ZoomInfo**: Provides B2B contact details and insights for better personalization.

•	**Snov.io**: Another email finding and enrichment tool that’s great for smaller lists.

3.	**Best Practices for Email Enrichment**

•	Ensure you’re validating email addresses to avoid bounce rates and deliverability issues.

•	**Example**: Use tools like Hunter.io or NeverBounce to verify emails before sending campaigns.

4.	**Automating Enrichment Workflows**

•	Use enrichment tools in conjunction with your scraping workflows for a seamless lead generation process.

•	**Example**: Automatically scrape LinkedIn profiles, feed the data into Clearbit or Hunter.io for enrichment, and use the cleaned list in your CRM or outreach tool.

**Real-Life Examples for Prospecting**

1.	**Using Scraping and Digital Touchpoints**

“For example, you’re targeting startup founders interested in growth. By following Y Combinator’s LinkedIn page and scraping the ‘followers’ list or event attendees, you’ll get a refined list of startup founders actively engaging with growth-related content.”

2.	**Tuning LinkedIn Searches**

“Instead of using LinkedIn’s standard search, combine Boolean searches like ‘Marketing AND Automation AND SaaS’ with profile filters to get a more accurate list of relevant prospects.”

3.	**Email Enrichment Example**

“You scrape LinkedIn profiles for VP of Marketing in mid-sized SaaS companies, but don’t have email addresses. Using Hunter.io, you enrich the list and get the verified contact details you need for outreach.”

2.	**Segment and Prioritize**:

•	Refine your list based on key attributes in your ICP (job titles, industries, regions).

3.	**Scraping for Accuracy**:

•	For top-tier prospects or niche targets, use scraping tools to verify and expand upon the data. For example, scrape LinkedIn posts or event attendees to add real-time leads to your outreach.

4.	**Enrichment for Completeness**:

•	After scraping, use enrichment tools to verify emails and fill in any missing data, ensuring your outreach is **GDPR-compliant** and precise.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds):**

“By strategically using both databases and live scraping, you can balance volume and accuracy, ensuring you’re targeting the right people with the right information. In the next video, we’ll discuss how digital touchpoints can refine your ICP and help you reach prospects at the right time. See you there!”

**Video 2 Script: Digital Touchpoints and Refining Your ICP**

**Introduction (20 seconds):**

“Welcome back! In this video, we’ll cover the importance of digital touchpoints — the places where your ICP interacts online — and how they can help you build more precise and timely prospect lists.”

**Section 1: Digital Touchpoints as a Refinement Tool (1 minute):**

“Digital touchpoints are the online interactions that reveal **intent** and **engagement** from your ICP. By identifying and tapping into these touchpoints, you can refine your lists and reach prospects who are more likely to convert.

*Example*:

“If your ICP is SaaS founders, a relevant digital touchpoint might be **LinkedIn posts from Y Combinator** or SaaS-specific industry events. Scraping interactions from these posts gives you real-time insights into **active prospects**.”

**Section 2: Identifying and Leveraging Digital Touchpoints (1 minute 30 seconds):**

“Here’s how to identify and leverage these touchpoints effectively:

1.	**Identify High-Engagement Areas**:

Look for areas where your ICP spends their time, such as LinkedIn events, blog comment sections, or even specific Slack or Discord groups. These touchpoints reveal where your ICP is actively engaging with content.

2.	**Scrape Relevant Touchpoints**:

•	Use scraping tools like PhantomBuster to capture followers, event attendees, or post interactions. This data will be fresher and more relevant than static databases.

3.	**Target Based on Timing and Relevance**:

•	Once you have touchpoint data, target prospects **based on their recent activity**. For example, if a prospect just attended a ‘SaaS Scaling’ event on LinkedIn, they are likely more receptive to your outreach about growth solutions.”

**Section 3: Framework for Touchpoint-Based Outreach (1 minute 30 seconds):**

“Here’s a framework for building a touchpoint-based prospecting strategy:

1.	**Touchpoint Identification**:

•	Identify online events, posts, or communities where your ICP engages.

•	Example: Scrape the attendees of a ‘Scaling SaaS Companies’ LinkedIn event.

2.	**Scrape Interactions**:

•	Scrape relevant profiles from these interactions (comments, event participants) using tools like PhantomBuster.

3.	**Real-Time Outreach**:

•	Implement a workflow where scraped leads are automatically added to your CRM and tagged based on **engagement timing**. This ensures that you’re reaching out when they are most engaged.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds):**

“Leveraging digital touchpoints allows you to refine your prospecting in a more meaningful way. By targeting engaged leads, you increase the likelihood of success. In the next video, we’ll look into the common limitations of databases and how to fine-tune them for better results. See you soon!”
