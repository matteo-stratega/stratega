**Video 1: Building Trust and Awareness with Content**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Why Content is Essential Before Outreach**

•	Content is the foundation that builds trust and credibility before you even reach out to prospects.

•	The goal is to set up an **authority presence** and **educate** or **address strong needs** based on where your prospect is in their journey.

2.	**Painkillers vs. Vitamins: Addressing the Need**

•	**Painkiller Content**: Content that solves immediate, urgent problems your ICP faces. This type of content is high-value and often drives faster action.

•	**Example**: A case study showing how your product helped a client cut costs by 30%.

•	**Vitamin Content**: Content that educates and helps your audience grow over time. It’s not addressing an urgent pain point, but it builds trust and positions you as a thought leader.

•	**Example**: A blog post on long-term trends in your industry.

•	Knowing when to use **painkiller content** versus **vitamin content** is key to building a balanced content strategy.

3.	**Framework: Content Strategy for Trust Building**

•	**Awareness Content (Vitamins)**: Create educational content (blog posts, whitepapers, infographics) that introduces topics and helps prospects understand trends, challenges, or opportunities.

•	**Consideration Content (Painkillers)**: Provide solutions through detailed case studies, comparison guides, or success stories that directly show how your product solves a specific pain point.

4.	**Actionable Framework: AI for Content Creation**

•	Use **AI tools** like ChatGPT or Jasper to quickly generate content ideas and drafts based on your ICP.

•	**AI Prompt Example**:

•	“Write a 500-word blog post on ‘How Automation Can Reduce Overhead Costs for Tech Startups’ focusing on real-world examples and industry trends.”

•	**Framework**:

•	Create a list of educational content (vitamins) and problem-solving content (painkillers).

•	Use AI tools to generate drafts and fine-tune them for your specific audience.

**Video 2: Using AI to Refine Your Content Strategy (with Best Practices and Prompts)**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**AI’s Role in Content Strategy**

•	AI tools can streamline content creation, helping you generate high-quality, tailored content that resonates with your ICP.

2.	**Best Practices for AI-Driven Content**

•	**Keep it Personalized**: AI can help with first drafts, but it’s essential to customize the content for your audience and industry.

•	**Focus on Problem-Solving**: Every piece of content should either **educate** (vitamin) or **solve a problem** (painkiller).

•	**Iterate and Improve**: Use AI to generate multiple versions of a blog, landing page, or social post, and A/B test to see what resonates best.

3.	**Procedures: Using AI for Specific Content**

•	**Blog Posts**: Start with an ICP-focused prompt.

•	**Prompt**: “Create a blog post that educates SaaS founders about the top 3 challenges in scaling user acquisition, offering actionable insights.”

•	**Case Studies**: Use AI to generate first drafts of case studies and refine them with data.

•	**Prompt**: “Write a case study that shows how a mid-sized company increased efficiency by 25% using automation.”

•	**Landing Pages**: AI can help create draft landing pages that highlight pain points and solutions.

•	**Prompt**: “Write a high-converting landing page for a marketing automation tool that highlights how it saves 10 hours of manual work weekly.”

**Video 3: Structuring Content for LinkedIn + AI Prompt for LinkedIn Optimization**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**LinkedIn as a Content Hub**

•	LinkedIn is a platform for both educational content (vitamins) and problem-solving content (painkillers).

•	**Vitamins**: Share blog posts, industry insights, and thought leadership content.

•	**Painkillers**: Share client success stories, case studies, and product announcements.

2.	**How to Optimize LinkedIn Content Using AI**

•	Use AI to optimize LinkedIn posts for maximum engagement.

•	**Prompt Example**:

•	“Create a LinkedIn post that explains how using automation increased lead generation by 40% for SaaS companies, with a call-to-action to download a case study.”

3.	**LinkedIn Profile Optimization Framework (Using GPT)**

•	Guide users to optimize their LinkedIn profile to reflect their expertise, using AI-generated prompts.

•	**GPT Prompt Example for Profile Optimization**:

•	“Help me craft a LinkedIn profile for a growth marketer who specializes in B2B lead generation, with a focus on automation tools that drive efficiency.”

**Video 4: AI-Enhanced Social Selling Strategies + Daily LinkedIn Actions**

•	**AI-Enhanced Social Selling Routine**:

•	**Morning**: Use AI to help draft thoughtful comments on ICP-related posts.

3.	**AI-Assisted LinkedIn Messaging**

•	Use AI to draft personalized LinkedIn messages for warm outreach.

•	**Prompt**: “Write a LinkedIn message to a SaaS founder congratulating them on recent funding and offering a free consultation to discuss how they can scale their lead generation efforts.”

**Real-Life Examples for Module 3**

1.	**Painkiller vs. Vitamin Example**:

“If you’re targeting marketing executives, your vitamin content might be a blog post on long-term trends in marketing automation. However, your painkiller content could be a case study showing how your tool increased MQLs by 50% in the last quarter, addressing an urgent pain point.”

2.	**AI for Content Creation Example**:

“For a SaaS company targeting healthcare, use AI to generate a blog post on ‘Why Automation is Essential for Compliance in Healthcare’ to educate (vitamin), and then create a case study on ‘How Our Automation Tool Reduced Compliance Errors by 25%’ to solve an immediate problem (painkiller).”

3.	**Social Selling Routine Example**:

“Every morning, spend 10 minutes liking and commenting on posts related to your industry. Use AI to help draft thoughtful comments that position you as an expert. Later in the day, use AI to craft a LinkedIn post that summarizes a blog post or case study, driving more engagement.”

# Video script

**Video 1 Script: Building Trust and Awareness with Content**

**Introduction (20 seconds):**

“Welcome to Module 3! In this session, we’ll explore how to create content that builds trust and awareness before launching your outreach campaigns. Remember, content is the foundation of a solid lead generation strategy — it either educates your audience or addresses their immediate needs.”

**Section 1: Why Content is Essential for Pre-Outreach (1 minute):**

“Before you reach out to prospects, you need to establish trust. There are two types of content that work:

1.	**Vitamins**: Content that educates and builds long-term trust. This helps prospects understand challenges or industry trends.

2.	**Painkillers**: Content that addresses an urgent, strong need or pain point. This type of content tends to drive quicker conversions because it provides an immediate solution.”

*Example*:

“Think of a blog post on ‘Future Trends in Automation’ as a vitamin. It’s educational and builds credibility. Now, imagine a case study on how your solution helped a client increase efficiency by 30% — that’s a painkiller, as it solves a pressing issue.”

**Section 2: Framework for Building Trust (1 minute 30 seconds):**

“To balance both content types, create a content strategy that targets different stages of your ICP’s journey.

1.	**Awareness Stage (Vitamins)**: Create educational blog posts, whitepapers, or videos that introduce common industry challenges.

2.	**Consideration Stage (Painkillers)**: Provide case studies, comparison guides, and detailed product information to show how your solution solves specific problems.”

*Example*:

“Let’s say you’re targeting SaaS founders. In the awareness stage, your vitamin content could be a blog post on ‘How SaaS Startups Can Scale Faster with Automation.’ In the consideration stage, your painkiller content could be a case study about a startup that cut costs by 20% using your product.”

**Section 3: AI for Content Creation (1 minute):**

“AI tools like ChatGPT or Jasper can streamline content creation by helping you generate ideas, outlines, and even full drafts based on your ICP’s needs. Here’s how you can use AI to save time and produce high-quality content.

•	**Prompt Example**: ‘Write a blog post about the top 3 challenges SaaS founders face when scaling user acquisition, with actionable tips.’

•	AI can also be used to fine-tune your CTAs, product descriptions, or landing page headlines.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds):**

“By creating a balance of educational (vitamins) and problem-solving (painkillers) content, and leveraging AI tools to speed up the process, you’ll build the foundation needed for successful outreach campaigns. In the next video, we’ll dive into competitor analysis and how to use tools like Sparktoro and SEMrush to find low-hanging fruit. See you there!”

**Video 2 Script: Competitor Analysis Using Sparktoro and SEMrush**

**Introduction (20 seconds):**

“Welcome back! In this session, we’ll discuss how competitor analysis can help you identify content opportunities and optimize your landing pages. We’ll use tools like SEMrush and Sparktoro to gather insights that will give you an edge.”

**Section 1: Why Competitor Analysis Matters (1 minute):**

“Competitor analysis helps you learn what’s already working in your market, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. You can find content, UX/UI elements, and even social media strategies that resonate with your audience.

1.	**SEMrush**: Use SEMrush to analyze the keywords and content that drive traffic to your competitors’ websites.

2.	**Sparktoro**: Find out where your audience spends time online, which blogs they read, and which podcasts they follow.”

*Example*:

“Let’s say SEMrush shows that a competitor’s blog post on ‘Automation Trends 2024’ is performing well. You can create a more niche-focused version or add more in-depth insights to capture part of their traffic.”

**Section 2: Using SEMrush for Content and Landing Page Optimization (1 minute 30 seconds):**

“SEMrush allows you to analyze competitors’ top-performing content, landing pages, and keywords. By reviewing these, you can see what UX/UI elements are working and which content resonates with your ICP.

•	**Example**: SEMrush shows that a competitor’s landing page with a short headline, a customer testimonial, and a strong CTA performs well. You can replicate that structure for your landing page, adding your own unique twist.”

**Section 3: Sparktoro for Audience Insights (1 minute):**

“Sparktoro is a great tool to find out where your ICP spends their time online. It shows you what blogs they read, which podcasts they listen to, and who they follow on social media.

•	**Example**: Sparktoro might reveal that a significant portion of your target audience follows a particular influencer or engages with specific LinkedIn groups. You can focus your content or ads on these touchpoints to increase your reach.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds):**

“Competitor analysis using SEMrush and Sparktoro allows you to identify low-hanging fruit in your market, refine your content strategy, and improve your landing pages. In the next session, we’ll look at how AI can help you create optimized content for blogs, case studies, and social media. See you soon!”

**Video 3 Script: AI-Enhanced Content Creation for Blogs, Case Studies, and Social Media**

**Introduction (20 seconds):**

“Welcome back! Now that you’ve done your competitor analysis, let’s talk about how to use AI to create content faster and more effectively. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate high-quality blogs, case studies, and social media posts, but we need to be mindful not to rely on AI to produce shallow content.”

**Section 1: AI for Blog and Case Study Creation (1 minute 30 seconds):**

“AI can take the legwork out of writing blogs and case studies, helping you create drafts quickly based on your ICP’s pain points or trending topics in your industry. However, it’s important not to abuse AI-generated content. AI should help fill the gaps, but the content still needs depth — it should have real ‘beef’ and not just ‘smoke.’

•	**Prompt Example for Blogs**: ‘Write a blog post on how mid-sized SaaS companies can scale their user base by automating customer acquisition.’

•	**Prompt Example for Case Studies**: ‘Write a case study about how a mid-sized SaaS company reduced costs by 30% using our automation tool.’

After generating a draft, it’s essential to enrich the content with your own insights, data, and industry expertise to ensure it’s valuable and relevant.”

**Section 2: AI for Social Media Posts (1 minute):**

“AI can help you create high-engagement social media content. Whether it’s a LinkedIn post, a Twitter thread, or an infographic, AI can generate the core content, but your role is to add the real substance.

•	**Prompt Example**: ‘Write a LinkedIn post explaining how using automation improved lead generation by 50% for SaaS companies, with a CTA to download a case study.’

Remember, AI can’t replace human expertise — it’s a tool that helps you scale your content, but it’s up to you to make sure it’s impactful and not just filler.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds):**

“AI is a powerful tool for creating blog posts, case studies, and social media content quickly and efficiently, but don’t fall into the trap of overusing it. The goal is to deliver meaningful, valuable content that resonates with your audience. In the next video, we’ll dive into how to optimize your LinkedIn profile and implement social selling strategies to engage with your ICP. See you there!”
