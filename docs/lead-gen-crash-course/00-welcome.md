# **1. Welcome & Course Overview (5 minutes)**

**Introduction (30 seconds):**

“Hi, I’m [Your Name], founder of Stratega and Chief Strategy Officer at PickEat. Over the years, I’ve worked with startups to build lead generation systems that consistently deliver results. At Stratega, we’ve averaged over a 60% reply rate and 15% closing rate by focusing on strategy, execution, and constant iteration. In this course, I’ll guide you through my proven process so you can replicate similar success.”

**Why This Course? (1 minute):**

“Lead generation is the lifeblood of any B2B startup, but it can feel overwhelming if you’re just starting out. My goal is to simplify the process and show you that it doesn’t take a huge budget or advanced technical skills to succeed. I’ve helped startups achieve incredible results using no-code tools and a strategic playbook, all while treating every part of the process as an experiment. The key to success isn’t avoiding failure — it’s embracing it and learning from it. I’ll show you how to make data-driven decisions so you can continuously improve.”

**Course Format (1 minute):**

“This course is divided into short, actionable videos of no more than 5 minutes each. In every session, we’ll cover one key aspect of the lead gen process — from identifying your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) to building your sales playbook. After each video, you’ll be ready to take the next step. By the end of this course, you’ll have a complete lead gen system that’s been tested and optimized based on real-world data and insights.”

**Who Is This Course For? (40 seconds):**

“Whether you’re a founder looking to grow your business, a sales leader building a team, or a marketer responsible for demand generation, this course is for you. We’ll cover everything from high-level strategy to hands-on execution, so no matter where you are in your journey, you’ll come away with practical knowledge to apply immediately.”

**What You’ll Learn (1 minute 10 seconds):**

“In this course, you’ll learn:

•	**Outreach Strategy**: How to define your ICP and use demand generation templates for personalized outreach.

•	**Sales Playbook**: You’ll get a deep dive into building a scalable, repeatable sales playbook that aligns your entire team on messaging, objection handling, and follow-ups.

•	**Tracking & Optimization**: Most importantly, you’ll learn how to treat every campaign as an experiment. We’ll focus on tracking the right KPIs and learning from both wins and losses to improve constantly.”

**Failure as Growth (45 seconds):**

“In the world of startups, failure is inevitable, but it’s also one of your greatest tools for growth. Every time you experiment, you’ll learn something new, and that’s how you refine your strategy. The lead generation process we’ll cover is designed with this in mind — we’ll track, optimize, and adapt. So, don’t fear the missteps. Instead, embrace them as part of your path to success.”

**Final Words (50 seconds):**

“This isn’t just another theoretical course. It’s based on real, proven methodologies that have delivered exceptional results. Whether you’re looking to generate leads or build a scalable sales playbook, you’ll find actionable strategies that you can start applying right away. So, let’s get started — and remember, every step forward, whether it’s a win or a lesson, brings you closer to success.”
