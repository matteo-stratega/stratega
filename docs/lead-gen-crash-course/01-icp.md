**Outline for Part 1 (with Client Journey & Demand Gen Templates)**

**Video 1: Understanding the ICP (The Human and Strategic Approach)**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Introduction to ICP**

•	Brief intro on why defining your ICP is crucial in lead generation.

•	Focus on understanding if you can help solve the person’s problem.

2.	**Client Journey Overview**

•	Introduce the client journey stages: Awareness → Consideration → Decision.

•	Explain how the ICP interacts with each stage, and how your messaging should evolve as the client progresses.

3.	**Social Animals in Business**

•	Humans make decisions based on connection and understanding.

•	Treat initial outreach as a discovery phase where you’re building rapport, not selling.

4.	**Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework**

•	Understand the jobs your prospect needs to get done and frame your offering around this need.

5.	**Four Forces Framework**

•	Quick overview: Push, Pull, Anxiety, Habit.

•	How these forces impact decision-making at each stage of the client journey.

**Conclusion**

•	Focus on validating the person’s needs and offering tailored solutions as they move through their journey.

**Video 2: Strategic ICP Validation (Client Journey, Company Details, and Demand Gen Templates)**

**Key Concepts**:

1.	**Company Details and Hierarchy**

•	Segment based on company size, industry, geography, and decision-making hierarchy.

•	Understand influencers vs. decision-makers.

2.	**Client Journey Applied to ICP**

•	At each stage of the client journey (Awareness → Consideration → Decision), adjust your targeting and messaging.

•	Example: In the awareness stage, focus on educating about a problem, while in the decision stage, focus on solution comparisons.

3.	**Demand Generation Templates**

•	Templates help structure your messaging at different stages of the journey:

•	**Awareness Stage**: Position yourself as a thought leader, highlight common challenges.

•	**Consideration Stage**: Show how your solution can solve their problem, use case studies, and testimonials.

•	**Decision Stage**: Provide detailed product information, pricing, and comparisons.

•	Personalization is key. Tailor these templates based on your ICP and the client’s stage in the journey.

4.	**Targeting as an Experiment**

•	Each detail (company, journey stage, messaging) is a variable in your experiment.

•	Test different templates to see what resonates at different stages.

**Conclusion**

•	Treat the ICP, client journey, and demand generation as a continuous loop of validation and iteration.

# Video Script

**Video 1 Script: Understanding the ICP (The Human and Strategic Approach)**

**Introduction (20 seconds)**:

“Welcome! In this session, we’ll be exploring one of the most critical aspects of lead generation: defining your Ideal Customer Profile, or ICP. This isn’t just about building a list of prospects; it’s about understanding the people behind those profiles and ensuring your approach is aligned with their needs. Let’s dive in.”

**Section 1: What is an ICP? (1 minute)**

“An ICP is your best guess, or hypothesis, about who your potential customers are. But it’s more than just demographics and firmographics; it’s about understanding their specific challenges and goals. And here’s the key: your ICP is not fixed. It evolves as you learn more about your prospects.

Think of it as an experiment — you start with a hypothesis, then validate or iterate based on real-world data. We’re not here to sell immediately; instead, we’re here to figure out if we can genuinely help solve a problem for this person.”

*Example*:

“Imagine you’re targeting a VP of Marketing at a mid-sized tech company. Sure, on paper, you know their title and company size, but that’s just the surface. That VP is juggling deadlines, stressed about quarterly targets, and might be looking for a way to improve their team’s efficiency. The more you research, the better you can tap into their real concerns. Maybe you find out that their company recently expanded — this could be your ‘in,’ framing your outreach around how your solution can help them scale effectively.”

**Section 2: The Client Journey (1 minute 20 seconds)**

“To really understand your ICP, you need to map it onto the client journey. The journey consists of three stages: Awareness, Consideration, and Decision.

1.	**Awareness Stage**: At this stage, your prospect may not even realize they have a problem. They’re looking for information and education, which means your messaging should be focused on bringing their challenges to light and providing value.

2.	**Consideration Stage**: Here, they know they have a problem, and they’re evaluating options. Your messaging should highlight how your solution fits their needs, through case studies or testimonials.

3.	**Decision Stage**: Now they’re ready to make a choice. This is where you provide detailed product information, comparisons, and pricing.

As your prospect moves through each stage, your ICP might evolve based on how they respond to different messaging. This is why it’s so important to treat your ICP and the client journey as dynamic, not static.”

*Example*:

“Think of an industry like healthcare. When you’re targeting a hospital administrator, at the Awareness Stage, they might not realize their manual processes are a problem. So, your first touchpoint could be a whitepaper about streamlining operations. But as they move to the Consideration Stage, they’ll be evaluating software options, so you should provide a case study of how your tool helped another hospital save time and reduce errors. By the Decision Stage, it’s all about proving ROI and offering pricing options that fit their budget.”

**Section 3: Social Animals in Business (1 minute)**

“Now, let’s talk about the human side. We are social animals, and business is about relationships. Your first outreach should be about building rapport and understanding — not selling. This is crucial: your prospect wants to feel understood, not sold to.

At this stage, ask questions. What’s their job to be done? What are their pain points? You’re here to help, and by focusing on understanding their needs, you position yourself as a problem solver.”

*Example*:

“Let’s say you’re targeting a CEO at a growing startup. Maybe you discover that they’ve just raised a new round of funding. Instead of pushing your product, start by congratulating them and asking about their growth goals. This shows you’re paying attention and positioning yourself as someone who’s interested in their success, not just pushing a sale.”

**Section 4: The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework (1 minute 10 seconds)**

“The Jobs to Be Done framework is an excellent tool for understanding your prospects. It helps you shift the focus from what your product does to what job your prospect is trying to accomplish.

For example, a customer might not care about your software’s features — they care about whether it will save them time or help them grow revenue. When you frame your offering in terms of the job they need to get done, you align your messaging directly with their needs.

This is part of why it’s so critical to ask questions early on in your engagement: you’re not just validating their interest in your product — you’re figuring out if your product solves their actual problem.”

*Example*:

“A COO might be looking to ‘hire’ a software tool to help with automation, but their underlying job is to reduce team burnout and improve efficiency. When you ask about their biggest challenges, you’ll find this out. Then, you can position your product as the tool that will save them hours of manual work, making their team happier and more productive.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds)**

“To wrap up, defining your ICP is about more than just targeting the right companies. It’s about understanding the people within those companies, the journey they’re on, and the jobs they’re trying to accomplish. You want to validate your assumptions before you even think about selling.

In the next session, we’ll dive deeper into the strategic side of ICP validation, including company details, hierarchical structures, and how demand generation templates can guide your messaging. See you there!”

**Video 2 Script: Strategic ICP Validation (Company Details, Journey, and Demand Gen Templates)**

**Introduction (20 seconds)**:

“Welcome back! Now that we’ve discussed the human side of defining your ICP, it’s time to explore the more strategic elements: how to validate your ICP through company details, the client journey, and how demand generation templates can help structure your outreach.”

**Section 1: Company Details and Hierarchy (1 minute 30 seconds)**

“First, let’s break down company details. When defining your ICP, factors like industry, company size, and geography all play a critical role. Why? Because different companies, depending on these factors, will have different needs and challenges.

For example, a small SaaS company in the technology sector might be looking for ways to scale quickly, while a larger enterprise in healthcare might prioritize compliance and security.

But it’s not just about the company as a whole. It’s also essential to understand **who** within the company you’re targeting. Are you speaking to a decision-maker, like a CEO or VP, or someone at the influencer level, like a manager or team lead? The content and tone of your messaging will vary depending on their role and influence in the decision-making process.”

*Example*:

“When you’re targeting a large manufacturing company, the VP of Operations might be focused on reducing costs, while the IT Manager is more concerned about integration with existing systems. Your outreach should address both perspectives. For the VP, emphasize cost-saving features, and for the IT Manager, talk about easy setup and compatibility.”

**Section 2: Client Journey Applied to ICP (1 minute 30 seconds)**

“Let’s now connect this to the client journey we covered earlier. Each stage of the journey — Awareness, Consideration, and Decision — needs a different type of messaging.

At the **Awareness Stage**, your prospect is just learning about their problem, so focus on education. In the **Consideration Stage**, they’re comparing solutions, so position your product as the best fit with case studies or detailed use cases. And at the **Decision Stage**, they’re ready to buy, so now it’s time to present clear information on your product, including pricing and implementation.”

*Example*:

“Let’s take an example from the finance industry. A CFO at a mid-sized firm might not initially see the need for automation in their processes, so in the Awareness Stage, you provide a report showing how automation reduces errors. By the time they reach the Decision Stage, they’re convinced, and now you need to show them how your tool is the best choice — offer ROI data and a pricing plan.”

**Section 3: Demand Generation Templates (1 minute 20 seconds)**

“Now, let’s talk about demand generation templates. These are pre-structured frameworks that help guide your messaging across different stages of the client journey.

1.	**Awareness Templates**: These focus on high-level educational content. Think of blogs, eBooks, or whitepapers that help prospects understand their problem and position you as a thought leader.

2.	**Consideration Templates**: At this stage, use case studies, webinars, or product demos to show how your solution fits their needs.

3.	**Decision Templates**: Now it’s time for more direct communication, like pricing, product specs, and one-to-one consultations to close the deal.”

*Example*:

“If you’re targeting HR professionals in the Awareness Stage, an eBook on trends in employee retention could grab their attention. In the Consideration Stage, a case study on how your software reduced turnover for a similar company will be more impactful. By the Decision Stage, you’re offering a free trial or detailed demo to convince them your solution is the best fit.”

**Conclusion (40 seconds)**

“In this session, we’ve covered the strategic side of validating your ICP — from understanding company details and hierarchy to applying the client journey and demand generation templates. The goal is always the same: validate before selling and adjust your approach based on what you learn.

In our next module, we’ll dive into building your offering. We’ll help you structure a value proposition that resonates with your ICP, making your outreach even more effective. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next video!”

These real-life examples will help your audience not only understand the theories behind ICP, client journeys, and demand generation but also inspire them to think critically about how to apply these principles in their specific industries and scenarios.
