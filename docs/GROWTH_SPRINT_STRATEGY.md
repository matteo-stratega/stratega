# Growth Sprint Strategy - Beat Cold IQ
*Acquire 100 → Identify Winners → Upsell Segments → Scale*

**Date:** 24 Nov 2024
**Goal:** €1,349 MRR through data-driven segmentation + Crono partnership
**Timeline:** 5 weeks (Dec 2024)
**Competitor Target:** Cold IQ (let's crush them)

---

## 🎯 The Smart Play

**Old plan:** Convert 30 existing → €490 MRR (risky, maybe they don't convert)
**New plan:** Acquire 100 free → Track completion → Upsell winners → Scale segments
**Immediate revenue:** Crono.one expert (€100/hr) = bridge to MRR

---

## 💰 3 Revenue Streams (Parallel)

### 1. Crono.one Expert Partnership (€400-800/month immediate)
- **Rate:** €100/hour consulting
- **Target:** 4-8 hours/month (low volume, high value)
- **Positioning:** Growth + automation expert for Crono clients
- **Setup:** Week 1 (get listed as expert, first client)

### 2. School Free Acquisition → Segment Upsell (€500-700/month by Week 5)
- **Acquire 100 users free** (LinkedIn sprint campaigns)
- **Track who completes modules** (engagement = buying intent)
- **Segment by ICP** (agencies, consultants, founders, etc.)
- **Upsell premium to winners** (€49-99/month per segment)
- **Conservative:** 10 conversions = €490-990 MRR

### 3. Multi-Platform Content → Inbound (€0-200/month by Week 5)
- **Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, HN** (distribute, don't create from scratch)
- **Repurpose school content** (automation = no extra work)
- **Beat Cold IQ on visibility** (show up where they don't)
- **Inbound leads → school funnel**

**Total Target:** €900-1,700/month (over goal, diversified risk)

## 📊 The LinkedIn Segmentation Sprint

**You have 5K connections. Let's turn them into data.**

### Week 1: Segment + Launch 3 Test Campaigns

**Identify 3 ICP Segments from your 5K:**
1. **Agencies/Consultants** (growth services)
2. **B2B Founders** (need lead gen for their startups)
3. **Corporate Marketers** (learn growth without quitting job)

**Campaign per segment:**
- DM 50 people per segment (150 total)
- Offer: "Free access to Stratega Growth Academy - I'm testing content, want early access?"
- Track: Who signs up, who starts Module 1, who completes Module 1

**Target:** 30-40 signups from 150 DMs (20-27% conversion)

---

### Week 2: Content Distribution + Track Engagement

**Push school content to Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn:**
- Take Module 1 content → turn into 5 posts
- Reddit: r/entrepreneur, r/startups, r/marketing
- Twitter: Threads on growth frameworks
- LinkedIn: Carousel posts to 5K connections
- CTA: "Full framework in my free school"

**Track in school platform:**
- Who completes Module 1? (high intent)
- Who drops off? (wrong ICP or bad content)
- Which segment has highest completion? (winner = who to upsell)

**Target:** 30 more signups from content (60 total)

---

### Week 3: Double Down on Winner Segment

**Data review:**
- Which of 3 segments has highest completion rate?
- That's your winner → focus 100% there

**Campaign:**
- DM another 100 people in WINNER SEGMENT ONLY
- Show social proof ("30 agencies already learning this")
- Offer free access + "upgraded tier coming soon"

**Target:** 40 more signups in winner segment (100 total reached!)

---

### Week 4: Launch Paid Tier to Winners Only

**Who gets the upsell offer:**
- ONLY people who completed Module 1 (engagement = intent)
- ONLY in winner segment (data-driven targeting)

**Offer:**
- "You completed Module 1 - want Modules 2-5 + live calls + templates?"
- Price: €49-99/month (test both prices in A/B)
- Bonus: "First 10 get €99/month for €49 lifetime"

**Conservative conversion:**
- 50 completed Module 1
- 20% convert = 10 paid users
- €49/month = €490 MRR (or €99 = €990 MRR)

---

### Week 5: Scale + Multi-Platform Push

**Scale what worked:**
- Winner segment = new 100-person DM campaign
- Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn = 3x content output (automate with n8n)
- Crono clients = upsell to school if relevant

**Target:** 15 paid users = €735-1,485 MRR

---

## 🔧 Crono.one Partnership Structure

**What you told me:**
- Great friend/partner with Crono.one
- They want to make you expert
- €100/hour consulting rate

**The play:**
1. **Week 1 setup:**
   - Get listed on Crono expert directory
   - Define your services (growth audits, automation consulting, lead gen strategy)
   - Set 4-8h/month cap (manageable)

2. **Week 2-5 execution:**
   - Take 1-2 clients/month
   - 2-4 hours per client
   - €400-800/month immediate cash (bridge to MRR)

3. **The conversion funnel:**
   - Crono clients → recommend school if they want to learn
   - School students → recommend Crono if they need done-for-you
   - Cross-pollination = value for both

**This is fast money while school scales.**

## 🚀 Multi-Platform Distribution (Automate Everything)

**You already have n8n + Supabase. Let's use them.**

### Content Repurposing Flow (Build Week 1):
1. **Source:** School module (written content)
2. **n8n automation:**
   - Turn into LinkedIn carousel (Canva API)
   - Turn into Twitter thread (GPT-4 API)
   - Turn into Reddit post (formatted for each subreddit)
3. **Schedule:** Publish across platforms simultaneously
4. **Track:** Which platform drives most signups (double down there)

### Platforms Priority:
1. **LinkedIn** (5K connections = distribution unlocked)
2. **Reddit** (r/entrepreneur = 3M members, hungry for growth content)
3. **Twitter** (build in public + indie hacker community)
4. **HackerNews** (if technical content about n8n/automation)

**Goal:** Show up EVERYWHERE Cold IQ doesn't. Outpublish, outvalue, outlast.

---

## 📈 The Segmentation Tracker (Build Week 1)

**You need data to know who converts. Track this in Supabase:**

### User Attributes:
- Segment (Agency, Founder, Corporate)
- Signup source (DM, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Modules completed
- Time to completion
- Engagement score (logins, time spent)

### Conversion Triggers:
- IF Module 1 complete + Segment = Winner → Send upsell email
- IF 3 modules complete → Offer premium (they're hooked)
- IF inactive 7 days → Re-engagement campaign

**This is growth hacking, not guessing.**

## 🔥 Why This Beats Cold IQ

**Cold IQ's model:** Sell courses at scale, no community, no personalization
**Your model:** Free access → community → data-driven upsell → segment winners

**Your advantages:**
1. **5K LinkedIn connections** (distribution they don't have)
2. **Real consulting background** (credibility vs. course sellers)
3. **Multi-platform presence** (LinkedIn + Reddit + Twitter = omnichannel)
4. **n8n automation** (you can outpublish them with less work)
5. **Segment-specific upsells** (personalized vs. generic courses)

**You're not competing on content. You're competing on execution + distribution.**

## ✅ Next Actions (Now)

Tell me:
1. **Crono partnership:** Can you get expert listing live this week?
2. **5K connections:** Do you have LinkedIn Sales Navigator or can export list?
3. **School tracking:** Can you add tracking code or do we need Supabase integration?
4. **n8n flows:** Show me what's already built so we activate, not rebuild
5. **Winner segment hypothesis:** Which of 3 (Agency/Founder/Corporate) do you think converts best?

Then we start Week 1 sprint immediately.

**No more long docs. Just execution.**
