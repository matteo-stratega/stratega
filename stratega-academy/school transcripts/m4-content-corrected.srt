00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,960
Here we go, guys. Welcome to module

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
4: Content that Converts.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,410
There is no campaign without content. I'll make you

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,000
a ton of examples, but by that

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,200
I mean assets for your company that

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,030
will make the sales process helpful

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,550
or also hooks for the prospects that we

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,160
can use to gather feedback or to sell a product

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,760
or something. So let's start as per usual with

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,440
the mistakes. Again: stop selling,

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,960
but start helping. Validation will

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,610
be the answer. We'll see

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,220
everything later, but most of the time, when I've

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,520
seen SDRs at the higher level or even at the beginning,

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,520
again, we were just sending an email, selling a feature.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,130
At best, it was a PDF, and that was it. So

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,950
that PDF was actually content built

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,900
for inbound. So again, we have to be relevant

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,650
here. What are we doing? Okay, so it's better

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,370
to have no content than bad content at all. But

21
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,100
we'll see how, with a little effort, we can

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,870
create something together. And the other thing

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,610
is that no journey was designed, so meaning

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,860
what does this person need to know at this specific point?

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,060
Because when you buy a TV, when you buy software, when

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,670
you buy anything, you will learn bit by

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,280
bit what you need to know. What you're

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
buying it for the vision, what kind of size

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,630
for the light you have in the room, what should

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,320
be the contrast, and so on. So you learn everything bit by bit, and

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,040
everything should be the same for prospecting.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,360
So we'll see how to do this with three simple frameworks.

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,460
The first is what I call "user type." It's not really a framework.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,010
We'll see. The second one is the lead generation template,

35
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,520
so we'll design the journey, and then we'll do a little bit

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,170
of positioning and brand positioning as the

37
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,780
last bit. So the first thing

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,500
is my prospect, the person

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,430
that I just described. Is my

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,140
CEO aware or not aware of the problem? And

41
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,440
is that person aware or not aware of the solution?

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,970
So my personal target from this

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,650
example is solution aware, because

44
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,330
they're trying to improve sales. Most of them are

45
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,970
trying to build something or they're trying to improve. So

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,590
they are my target, and my content should

47
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,510
be focused on that specific niche, which

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,050
doesn't mean "what is an outbound tool?"

49
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,590
That's not an article that I'm going

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,210
to write. But I can write a guide like

51
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,760
this with this specific framework. So

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,810
you will have to understand if your target persona

53
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,500
is problem aware, problem unaware, or solution

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,440
aware, so you can decide where to focus on in terms of content.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,130
And that will make you more relevant, and that will

56
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,640
make you more attractive and appealing.

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,360
Then we have to do the lead generation template,

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,250
as I was explaining before. Where does the journey

59
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,780
start? Where does my CEO try

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,530
to understand more about sales, about creating

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,330
a go-to-market strategy, about creating a lead generation

62
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,010
strategy, which tools to use? So where do they

63
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,870
start? What then do they need to learn

64
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,400
about my product? And what will affect

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
the discovery and decision making?

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,700
That is incredibly important. And as an example,

67
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,560
my CEO will talk to ChatGPT, Google. They will most

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
likely use LinkedIn. It could be a lot of

69
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,000
communities, as we've seen before, and they will look for frameworks,

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,720
tools, inspiration, case studies, and LinkedIn influencers.

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,260
So they will start learning from there. Then they will

72
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,930
see case studies and a growing need for structure because they

73
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,720
might have tried something, but they didn't get results, blah, blah,

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,230
blah, blah. So this person is moving

75
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,080
on a journey that eventually will help

76
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,870
you convert them. And all along the way,

77
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,700
the more you have bits in your copywriting or the

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,610
more you have bits in your landing pages. So I meant content

79
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,280
goes everywhere. This goes on your landing

80
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,020
page, that goes in your FAQ, that goes in the PDF,

81
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,950
that goes in the video. Because if you make

82
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,560
clear to them, for instance, that this course

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,620
is going to be free always for pre-seed startups,

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,760
and it's done, right there within the decision making,

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,560
I potentially removed the blocker of the pricing.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,220
Do you know what I mean? So this is going to be

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,800
really important for you. Okay, so you're

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,350
going to see this last little problem. I spent

89
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,140
a lot of time on this. Then that's your

90
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,680
turn now. Build your content. I want you to build

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,480
the content for the awareness phase, the discovery phase, and the conversion

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,080
phase. Just an idea and a track.

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,980
Not the whole thing, unless you do have it already,

94
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,050
and do the frameworks. But I will make

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,400
you examples of what kind of content

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,080
I mean, so you can be creative.

97
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,000
From the awareness perspective, for instance, if you're trying to sell software or something,

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,760
you can interview five experts and publish a blog article.

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,360
That's some kind of content you can also use in your lead

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,180
generation strategy, by interviewing the

101
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,920
person or using the blog article as something that can

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,200
help the people.

103
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,720
Discovery. I could potentially build

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,430
a tool page on my website and link the people in

105
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,210
and use it as something that I can attract people

106
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,010
to. This stuff goes a lot on

107
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,540
LinkedIn. And also conversion. Again, we

108
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,480
can write a blog case study, make a video on YouTube

109
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,360
or a webinar with the client that we can also use.

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,110
These are examples. Please try to fill out the

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,940
journey and try to build one piece of content for each.

112
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,940
And you can do it. Key takeaways.

113
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,900
Pause on that.

114
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,650
Journey. It's important that you design the journey. It's important

115
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,430
that you design the entry point. The more you design it, the more relevant you'll

116
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,460
be with your copywriting. The more effective will be the campaign.

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,990
The more effective will be your marketing

118
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,590
overall. And assets. Again, try

119
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,280
to use assets that are reusable and

120
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,080
scalable. Or if they're not scalable, for instance,

121
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
you have to interview a person, well, that has high value.

122
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,320
So that's fine. Okay, so that's

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,000
it. Going back: bonus

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
time, because you can add this

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,570
to additional things. So

126
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,220
building content with using traditional frameworks.

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,030
So this will help you position your brand and

128
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,540
make an understanding of where to place

129
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,230
yourself in the market. So for instance, if

130
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,970
you're low paying, like vitamins, you will

131
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,880
need to have a lot of content that is selling

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,440
the benefits of the vitamins.

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,450
But on the other perspective, if you're a painkiller and you have a headache,

134
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,120
I will just go to a pharmacy and buy one.

135
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
So that doesn't need educational content.

136
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,220
If you move the toggles here and there,

137
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,340
you will understand what kind of effort

138
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,080
to put in the content, for who, and

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,480
when, and who to sell to. And the other

140
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,690
thing: you can build content, as I mentioned,

141
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,240
one for awareness, one for blah, blah, blah,

142
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,060
the previous scheme. You can use this additional scheme.

143
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,600
If you like it, I really like it because it gives

144
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,140
me, when I ask myself questions, a lot of

145
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,930
answers, thinking about the prospect. So you can use this

146
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,610
as a guide because it will help you understand why

147
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,290
your product is helpful but not essential. So we'll

148
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,120
try to switch the perspective and make it essential. We'll

149
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,520
try to find the best showcase, and that's pretty important.

150
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,360
And eventually, you can build offer amplifiers. So you can

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,740
have the cherry on the pie. Okay.

152
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,380
Next, we'll puzzle everything up

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,900
and do some copywriting together.

154
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,440
So I hope you're excited because we are moving towards the,

155
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,180
we are actually just past the mid-chapter of it.

156
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,620
If you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, I'll see you next time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
