00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,590
Hello everyone, welcome to chapter

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,270
5, Kobe writing now. This

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,000
is one of my favorites because I will

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,600
try to challenge you deeply on this.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,550
So let's see the mistakes that we see usually

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,180
when trying to do lead generation. So

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,090
people usually sound like really salesy,

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,680
"A we do this and this, that we provide you this, would

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,520
you..." blah blah blah. Okay, it's annoying.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,340
Or sometimes you see the novels, but

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,960
the end thing is that they all sound a little bit

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,590
spammy, unpersonalized and yeah, it

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,430
just doesn't work. So I want you to make

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,280
a deal with me, would you be up for it just

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,440
for two weeks? So we'll try to take a different approach.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,670
We will try to validate something instead

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,440
of trying to sell it. Okay, I'll make

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,040
a tough example on a SaaS and we'll see how we

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,550
can take this, but I would like you to test for your next

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,680
campaign validating and we'll see what that means in a second.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,510
Check my hand. Okay, let's

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,040
go. So I write my goal for my perspective

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,700
action. So what I want to do

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,740
with my CEO, I want to understand

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,320
if they're trying to build a

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,700
sales playbook, to build a lead generation strategy,

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,760
to build the go to market strategy so I can help

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,540
them. And I can try ways to try

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,860
to find ways to ask them these specific

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,280
questions without being salesy.

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Because if I'm salesy, they will never do

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,410
me a referral. But if I ask something

33
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,380
kindly and nicely, then I could always

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,420
say, well, do you know anybody who needs

35
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,940
this? Okay. As

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,550
simple as

37
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,240
that.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,960
We might start up like we made the first two deals like this.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,950
Okay. So no sales understanding, trying

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,160
to build a relationship and there is no I, we do this,

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,200
we do this, we do this, we do this. It's about the

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,640
prospect always. 100% of the time.

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,480
Okay. Now we're going to see a couple

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,480
of frameworks as per usual. So the channels, obviously

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,120
that's super important. The corporate writing frameworks, if

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
you don't know, there are a lot of frameworks like IEDAPAS, FAP,

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,660
4PDS, they're all different. So it's ways of,

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,690
it's their frameworks. So it's ways of explaining

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,400
something and leading to the path of the journey that the

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,250
user is supposed to make. And we'll

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,790
see the timeline, obviously by tier. Now coming to the

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,360
channel, mail, it's really important to be able to cut the noise.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,280
So we have to be different. LinkedIn and communities

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,430
always relationship first and phone really clear,

55
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,970
quick and structured. Now about how to test

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,590
the channel, I would recommend you like every

57
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,130
two to four weeks to try to change channel,

58
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,720
starting with what you design with the IEDAPAS.

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,390
So with my CEO will be LinkedIn first and email

60
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,920
second, but then I could also try LinkedIn

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,720
only or email only or the both

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,300
of them. So then I know what and how

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,910
I can scale stuff because like email is more

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,770
scalable of course than LinkedIn, phone is less

65
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,380
scalable. So we need to find

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,270
the best way to do it and to

67
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,900
find a window. So it's a process

68
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,180
that is always ongoing. Now as an example of a framework

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,240
we got IEDAPAS, so we need to attract the user first,

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,890
stimulate the interest, then spark desire and ask

71
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,440
them to perform an action and to do this we're

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,560
going to be using LinkedIn and email.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,430
Now something really personal, this is my personal

74
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,250
flow. What I actually do is sit down and

75
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,820
write this stuff by hand before I

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,430
design each campaign and everything

77
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,160
pretty much is a recap so it helps me

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,770
bring back the memories. Or the

79
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,410
most important thing to me is this last question,

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,010
what would you tell this person if you were

81
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,680
to meet at the bar during an industry

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
event? So this is usually my opening

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,400
because I want to start a conversation.

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,170
Now we are going to make a different

85
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,810
example. So we are targeting wealth,

86
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,560
we are a SaaS, we do AI research so it's a little

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,420
bit more complicated than the free

88
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,540
school for founders and we're going

89
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,290
to use the customer interview as

90
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,880
a hook. The goal is for us to validate if

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,200
they do market research with AI and the target is wealth.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,710
So the first thing I'll try to get the interview, then

93
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,390
I'll try to build trust and showcase the benefit, then

94
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll interview follow up and then I'll make the offer and

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,840
I'll use LinkedIn and email as channels.

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,620
So writing everything down, I'm targeting the

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,280
marketing is my ICP, they need more research

98
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,250
data, I interviewed them together, their knowledge, if they're really

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,960
using it, how they're benefiting at this,

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,780
I can offer them a POC at cost if they want

101
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,950
to try the platform. These are the outcomes

102
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,200
and the question I would ask AI is disrupting

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,890
the industry, what is your take

104
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,640
on that? And I can also within

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,170
this feed POC, sorry feed a demo of the

106
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,770
platform somehow. So if I were to write this

107
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,340
person, the first message would be about qualification

108
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,200
and notice you've been at the marketing for quite a few years,

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,250
must have been a rally, especially now that AI kicked

110
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,760
in and did this, okay, and changed

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,170
the way we do market research. Actually

112
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,450
I reached out about an interviews,

113
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,280
mind if I share a bit more, so I'm

114
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,290
not being too much. Then moving

115
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,920
to step two, I would try to build trust

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,760
and spark interest saying, well, I'm

117
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,780
a tail, this is my job title that of course

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,120
is relevant and we work on AI market research

119
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,870
and we are running this kind of

120
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,020
interview because relevant because

121
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,600
AI disrupted the way we do this,

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,440
now we can achieve this in that.

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,320
Would you be willing to take an interview on this?

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,980
Are you already working with AI? Are you

125
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,000
already market, are you seeing these benefits?

126
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,870
Because I'm showcasing this and I also want to see

127
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,360
if this person is already using one of my competitors

128
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,040
because if not, okay, that's one really

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,800
big point for us. Then I'll write the email

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,440
in case they don't get back to me on LinkedIn.

131
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,600
We are wrapping up so I can add the urgency,

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,440
we are wrapping up the interviews since

133
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,270
AI short interviews and marketing

134
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,120
are saying this to achieve this.

135
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,750
If you're willing to share your expertise, we love you to join the

136
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,590
other 25 experts so we are adding a little

137
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,290
bit of social proof. The last email,

138
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,920
again, we didn't sell anything because we don't know

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
if we are the right solution for them

140
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,820
and this is the right prospect

141
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,460
for us. Today is the last shot to be part

142
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,370
of the study. Perhaps you are not already

143
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,660
into AI so we can use something that triggers

144
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,960
them emotionally because if not,

145
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,600
this is the thing. Did you check out

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,220
our website? There is a video right there. So this doesn't

147
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,890
embarrass anyone. They can take a look, it's quick. They

148
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,670
can just type a link so we can get a user

149
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,640
on our site and that is the exact begin

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,910
of the journey that we planned

151
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,760
from awareness to conversion.

152
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,730
Moving on, timeline and triggering, of course,

153
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,390
the same applies to triggers. Some of them are

154
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,160
quicker, some of them are not. We made the hardest one.

155
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,920
I made a lot of examples on the first and on the second.

156
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,600
We made the hardest one because that is

157
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,280
something that needs to be a little bit

158
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,850
oiled first. Key takeaways, validate,

159
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,730
don't sell. You shook my hand. Don't forget about

160
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,330
that. It's always for them and you can be

161
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,320
a lot creative here because a lot happens,

162
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,850
a lot of people have a lot of interest and of course they have a

163
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,560
lot of goals. So if you understand if these are the goals, you

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,160
can be creative and you can build a lot of things. And

165
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,850
the last thing I want to tell you is test, test, test. Try to change

166
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,410
angles. Try to, if you're doing cold email, spin taxing

167
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,050
or liquid syntax where you can change the sentences

168
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,670
according to stuff. Take a look into it

169
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,060
and test a lot of things. They'll be testing,

170
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,080
you probably know if not you can ask.

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,860
I will see you next time with tools

172
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:13,440
and your turn. [BLANK_AUDIO]
