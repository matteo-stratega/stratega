## DISCREPANCIES & NOTES

### Known Omissions (Non-Issues)
These slide elements are not explicitly named in transcripts but are conceptually covered:

1. **OMTM (One Metric That Matters)** - Module 7
   - Status: Conceptually present (baseline metric, target metric, leading indicators)
   - Impact: Low - framework is taught even if acronym not used
   - Assessment: Content accurate even without explicit acronym

2. **FAB (Features-Benefits)** - Module 5
   - Status: Referenced in slide but not explicitly named in video
   - Impact: Minimal - other copywriting frameworks clearly taught
   - Assessment: Course focus is on AIDA, PAS, 4PS primarily

### Uncertain References

**Module 3, Line 543:** "Pick a tier, design, and SAP"
- Context: ICP homework assignment
- Status: "SAP" appears unclear in context
- Assessment: Potentially legitimate term (possibly persona/profile reference)
- Action: Marked for potential review but left unchanged without video confirmation

## CORRECTION SUMMARY

### Corrections Applied

**File: `m5-copy-corrected.srt`**

**Correction #1: Framework Name Error**
- **Location:** Line 183 (Subtitle Entry 46)
- **Original Text:** "you don't know, there are a lot of frameworks like AIDA, PASTOR,"
- **Corrected Text:** "you don't know, there are a lot of frameworks like AIDA, PAS,"
- **Reason:** PASTOR is not a recognized copywriting framework. The correct framework taught in the course is PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- **Source Evidence:** MODULE 5 - COPYWRITING.pdf explicitly lists "PAS" in frameworks section
- **Impact:** Critical - ensures students learn correct framework name

**Correction #2: Capitalization Standardization**
- **Location:** Line 187 (Subtitle Entry 47)
- **Original Text:** "4Ps. They're all different. So it's ways of"
- **Corrected Text:** "4PS. They're all different. So it's ways of"
- **Reason:** Standardization with slide presentation (shows "4PS" consistently)
- **Source Evidence:** MODULE 5 - COPYWRITING.pdf shows "4PS" in frameworks list
- **Impact:** Medium - standardizes framework naming across course materials

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Enhanced Transcript Quality

1. **Add Framework Acronyms (Optional Enhancement)**
   - Consider adding explicit "OMTM (One Metric That Matters)" reference in Module 7 for clarity
   - Rationale: Already conceptually present, acronym would aid retention

2. **Clarify Ambiguous References**
   - Verify "SAP" reference in Module 3 homework assignment
   - If legitimate, add context; if typo, correct to intended term

3. **Consider Adding Section Headers**
   - Add framework names as markers (e.g., "[AIDA Framework]") before discussion
   - Would improve scannability and study utility

4. **Standardize Capitalization**
   - Framework names consistently capitalized as shown in slides
   - Applied to: PAS, 4PS, JTBD, AIDA
   - Already implemented for current corrections
