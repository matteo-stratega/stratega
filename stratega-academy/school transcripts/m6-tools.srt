1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,150
All right here it comes

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,300
my other favorite section that is tools

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,140
you know I own something

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,980
like 50/60 lifetime licenses

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,520
and I partner with a lot of these guys

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,230
back in the days when I was running the agency so

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,020
I've seen it all I tested them all for just for

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,280
fun at the beginning then it became the job and

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,470
I built infrastructures that go from like

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,400
just a bunch of emails a day to

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,190
managing 20 to 30 thousand

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,230
lits a month so I will help

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,840
you with the framework and you will

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,450
see that attached there is the

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,230
guide that I wrote for for another startup

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,840
about tools so you can download that and find

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,820
them yeah an additional more in-depth guide about

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,750
what we are seeing today so let's go

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,340
with the mistakes so the mistakes is basically

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,960
you're feeding your in your kid when it comes to tools at

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,170
least that's what happens with me flashing lights

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,720
we chase features because we get promised that

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,360
there is this database that works particularly well

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
but guys sales and software are two different things

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,320
you can do just fine and well enough

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,520
in the early days with the CRM and a

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,100
structured sales playbook and perhaps I'll tell

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,880
you later on what the sales playbook is or

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,400
if you are at the point where

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,610
you need to scale you must consider

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,710
quite about quite a few things so let's

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,890
move on and see as I was mentioning

33
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,840
you have a good market so when you're validating you're validating

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,660
you don't need much but when you're scaling you need

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,290
to think how can I scale how many lits

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,040
do I need so I need basically and we'll see that

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,940
in the last chapter how to reverse engineer

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,800
that so we will think it this way we'll

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,070
think I will convert 5-10%

40
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,350
of user coming down to demo

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,330
I need a scalable system that books me 10%

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,890
of the meeting the emails that I send

43
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,410
out how many prospects do I need and

44
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,990
within this which channels

45
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,620
do I use do I need to integrate with the CRM how

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,280
use how easy is that okay so

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,880
and all the other things so we go

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,630
into the tool evaluation phase now there

49
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,450
are kind of three main set of tools that

50
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,240
I would like to talk to you about the first

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,940
and the easiest one for you especially in the early

52
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,840
begin and early phase is an all-around tool

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,380
like for instance one of the

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,220
most famous is Apollo obviously you you

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,820
have a tool that is a database but also you can send

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,570
a bunch of emails and you can do a bunch of outreach actions

57
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,460
then you have LinkedIn only tools

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,100
you have email only tools phone only tools

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,000
and multi-channel tools that don't have a database

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,960
so perhaps you on in these tools you can

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,280
build the side of actions so that go from LinkedIn

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,940
to to email but you need to feed in

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,790
your database within that then you

64
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,340
have databases okay so

65
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,260
databases you can either

66
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,160
find them online so for instance

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,230
you're selling to hotels you can find hotels databases

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,010
online or you can scrape them okay so you can scrape

69
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,540
data in many ways you remember we're talking communities we

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,240
were talking in the impose there are actually tools that

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,840
will allow you to scrape certain posts on

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,810
LinkedIn or other social medias and do outreach

73
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,600
on these exact people so you can be specifically on point

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,320
because they fit your ICP within

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,620
that case you will need an

76
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,230
enrichment tool that kind of helps you out

77
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,110
filtering what data is good what data is not good so if

78
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,970
person from the company and they will

79
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,840
also give you the email address and other

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,760
couple data that then you can plug in

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,300
into your multi-channel tool

82
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,840
okay so these are the the three types ultimately you're

83
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,630
gonna need an outreach tool and you're gonna need some sort

84
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,440
of database if you're not going for an all-around solution but again

85
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,810
it depends on the go-to-market and the channels

86
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,010
so I prepared a few

87
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,100
example so let's say that you are a small

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,990
task selling as this small

89
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,500
task to load to your clients you need to

90
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,280
came on to the leads you're going email only you use app

91
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
spot so you need integration if you can manage

92
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,830
everything from there it's bonus point easy of

93
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,380
you so then I can hire junior staff for it

94
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,910
to be managed or a

95
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,440
VA virtual assistant and I

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,370
needed to be rolling out constant solutions

97
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,080
and I want to personalize the messages so

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,600
this is the features that I need so

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,150
listed from the variables and

100
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,950
so if also there is a benefit

101
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,030
to buying domains and buying email addresses directly

102
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,790
from them that that is a huge bonus point so I'm

103
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,510
going to be looking to be looking on the market

104
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,820
for something that fits these

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,550
exact needs okay instead

106
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,700
if I'm selling b2b SAS with high average

107
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,970
value of the leads and I need much lower

108
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,750
level but I need ease of use I need some kind

109
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,160
of BDR and prospecting that is a little bit more

110
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,700
on point with leads included I will go

111
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,280
for another round to that can enhance productivity

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,480
can go multi-channel can be integrated can have reporting

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,030
and yeah this is basically it

114
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,720
now there is a cheat sheet here

115
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,710
so there are a bunch of tools

116
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,220
that I already partnered with so for

117
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,170
around we have a polo chrono lamb list I'm giving

118
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,950
you a couple of automation tools that

119
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,670
are a little bit easier or a little bit

120
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,200
harder to learn it really depends on your high CP

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,820
and how on point you want to be and

122
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,380
yeah the stage of the the startup at

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,100
the beginning I usually recommend doing

124
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,200
structured work so even with the

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,820
with the support of the SAS but really do things manually so you

126
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,480
can learn all along the way the more you learn the

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,030
more you'll find a tool that really fits you to a

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,800
glove and and

129
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,470
yeah if you have questions about these tools let me know but also

130
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,000
again I'll be sharing my guide

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,680
so the key takeaways for this are

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,810
go to market rules so numbers will see the

133
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,360
next lesson the absolutely 100% rule

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,920
and scalable so we need to think limits of course

135
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,720
if we are handling cold calling we need x

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,490
amount of people same for LinkedIn profile so same

137
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,580
for email which you will need eventually domains

138
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,520
and x amount of email per domains and yeah so

139
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,240
you need to think about this when you're picking

140
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,980
up a tool and of course it has to be effective I don't

141
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,600
know again it depends on the stage you here so if

142
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,310
you really have a CRM or if you're really setting up an autonomy

143
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,920
automations we tools like make albato and then

144
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,770
and such so of course you need some kind

145
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,600
of flexibility from the perspective

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,260
okay so next up we will see we

147
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,080
will see the operational side

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,910
of it so track APIs and all the kind of stuff

149
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,440
and so yeah see you next
