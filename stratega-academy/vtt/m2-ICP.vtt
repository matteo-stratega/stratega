00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.540
Alright guys, welcome to module 2,

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.100
ICP. I'll split this into two parts: You're going

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.630
to see the company side of it and the people side of

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.400
it in module 3. I don't want to deep dive because

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.000
it's really important. Because I see most people

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
selling to everyone, and it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.300
They try to sell them the thing, but oh yeah, I selected

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.930
software development companies, 51 to

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.000
200, and I sent them my best offer, but I didn't get a response.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Guys, you need to be relevant today.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're bombarded constantly with ads. We are bombarded constantly with everything,

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.710
and sales is another channel that is also annoying.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.230
Unless you decide to

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.250
make things a little bit different,

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.000
you're not going to cut through the noise. It's impossible.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.690
We need to take all this and we need to do it

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.390
now because this happens both to pre-seed startups but also to people

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.000
that already have a sales process that is probably working

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.050
better than the one that the course is proposing. But sometimes

20
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.610
the campaigns go up and down, so you need to refresh

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.300
your point of view or you need to find something different. We'll

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.000
see how to find something different here from the company perspective.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.530
We're going to use three frameworks: The first is demographics, the second is triggers, and the third is tiering. With

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270
the first one, we're going to see all the company data that we

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.950
need. The triggers are going to identify something that can help us be more

26
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.600
relevant, and with the third one, we will avoid driving

27
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.660
ourselves crazy because it's taking too long

28
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.340
to sell just one single thing. We'll see the concept

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
of tiering. Now, before we even begin with

30
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.980
the first framework, remember you're never

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.850
selling to one single person. You're going to have a champion,

32
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.730
that is the person that is going to push you. You're going to have the

33
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.310
decision maker that will sign the agreement. It could be the

34
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.050
same as the champion. But you might also have an influencer, somebody

35
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610
that you can also get in touch with. You might have a person

36
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.630
that is reluctant to do anything. So you need to

37
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.360
tackle that when you sell. And you have

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.940
a gatekeeper, so somebody that might actually open the door for

39
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.760
you. It's really important that you understand this

40
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.290
because we have to convey this in personalized messaging and content later

41
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.990
on. Now, without further ado, demographics. What

42
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.610
I want to see is something like this.

43
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.440
I want to have enough detailed

44
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.000
data but not too granular.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.270
Meaning that I'm going in, say, as

46
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.000
a user of Apollo, and I'm trying to

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.590
find startups, up to five million, with the

48
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.130
company headcount. And I try to narrow it down

49
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.650
when I have a batch of two to five thousand.

50
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.640
So then I can make the campaign scalable. But if

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.000
I go below two thousand, that

52
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.630
might be too small. So I might go up. So this is

53
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.360
a flexible scheme, so you can add things

54
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.990
or you can remove things. But roughly five thousand,

55
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.000
thirty-five thousand, it's a good range for scaling

56
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.400
campaigns. So that is really important

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.040
for you to get right. Then triggers. We might find

58
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.600
out that there are some triggers, some updates that are

59
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.300
really good. So some of them could be just

60
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.400
related to the timeline that they have, or about

61
00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.340
social media updates that they publish.

62
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.000
So if they are preparing an event, I can get in touch because

63
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I can send my software for the event. So if I'm

64
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.770
going to a conference, that's another

65
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.360
way of doing outbound based on triggers.

66
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.000
So you cannot just manage triggers there, and they will look like this.

67
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So if there is any useful update: they are

68
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.700
hiring a new sales member, or they are

69
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.320
closing more clients. Or if you don't see

70
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.910
that they are closing clients, there could be some kind of trigger.

71
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.000
So please identify them and make good use of them.

72
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Whether you are in the first sales phase or whether you're in

73
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.590
the most advanced level where you're doing more

74
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.480
BDR kind of job. This is going to be really

75
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.240
helpful for you. Then tiering.

76
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.000
Without going crazy, you can't sell to anybody

77
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.660
at the same time or with the same timeline. You

78
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.250
always want to go for deals, but unless you know how

79
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.890
to sell them, unless you know the pain points of the

80
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.400
blockers in the buying committee, because they might block you there,

81
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.000
you're going to waste a lot of time in a sales cycle.

82
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So what we have to do is we have to keep in mind that

83
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.860
there are some deals that will be fast, and some will

84
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.520
be medium. Some deals will be long. So we need to build the outbound

85
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.340
campaigns within this ratio and within your company's

86
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.480
goals, so we can avoid losing our minds

87
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.000
and manage the sales pipeline and the

88
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.920
campaigns properly. For us,

89
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.700
like for example, it would be a pre-seed startup that

90
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.320
would be the easy sale, but a seed startup might take long because they have

91
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.090
more people, longer adoption, more proof needed, better social

92
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.880
proof, and the deals that I know will take three months. I will

93
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.720
decide when to reach out, and I can move

94
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.340
on with that. Now the key takeaways are the ones

95
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.070
in my voice. Target structure, okay.

96
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.000
Segmentation leads to scalability because when we find out

97
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.550
what works for that specific segment, we can then scale

98
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.060
the campaigns. Entry points will help you cut through

99
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.160
the noise. So really key, and we'll see later on also

100
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
with the personal standpoint how to do it with communities

101
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.420
and other channels, and target priorities.

102
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.000
So you can balance it out, so you can start reaching out to deals while

103
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.700
you try to close fast deals with, postpone the intermediate because

104
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.460
it also depends on the tools and the amount

105
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.130
of time you have for this. But we'll see also

106
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.770
that later on. If you have any questions, shout out. Otherwise,

107
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.280
I'll see you in a minute or two. It's now your turn.
