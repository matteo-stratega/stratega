00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.150
Alright, here it comes.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.300
My other favorite section: tools.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.140
You know, I own something

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.980
like 50-60 lifetime licenses,

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.520
and I partner with a lot of these guys

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.230
back in the days when I was running the agency. So

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.020
I've seen it all. I tested them all, just for

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.280
fun at the beginning. Then it became the job. And

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.470
I built infrastructures that go from like

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.400
just a bunch of emails a day to

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.190
managing 20 to 30 thousand

12
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.230
leads a month. So I will help

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.840
you with the framework, and you will

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.450
see that attached is the

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.230
guide that I wrote for another startup

16
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.840
about tools, so you can download that and find

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.820
them. Yeah, an additional, more in-depth guide about

18
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.750
what we are seeing today. So let's go

19
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.340
with the mistakes. So the mistake is basically:

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960
you're feeding your inner kid when it comes to tools. At

21
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.170
least that's what happens with me. Flashing lights,

22
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.720
we chase features because we get promised that

23
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.360
there is this database that works particularly well.

24
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.880
But guys, sales and software are two different things.

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.320
You can do just fine and well enough

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
in the early days with a CRM and a

27
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.100
structured sales playbook. And perhaps I'll tell

28
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.880
you later on what the sales playbook is. Or

29
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.400
if you're at the point where

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.610
you need to scale, you must consider

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.710
quite a few things. So let's

32
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.890
move on and see. As I was mentioning,

33
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.840
you have a good market. So when you're validating, you're validating.

34
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.660
You don't need much. But when you're scaling, you need

35
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.290
to think: how can I scale? How many leads

36
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.040
do I need? So I need basically, and we'll see that

37
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.940
in the last chapter, how to reverse engineer

38
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.800
that. So we will think it this way: We'll

39
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.070
think I will convert 5-10%

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.350
of users coming down to demo.

41
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.330
I need a scalable system that books me 10%

42
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.890
of the meetings from emails that I send

43
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.410
out. How many prospects do I need? And

44
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.990
within this, which channels

45
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.620
do I use? Do I need to integrate with the CRM? How

46
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.280
easy is that? Okay. So

47
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.880
and all the other things. So we go

48
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.630
into the tool evaluation phase. Now, there

49
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.450
are kind of three main sets of tools that

50
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.240
I would like to talk to you about. The first

51
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.940
and the easiest one for you, especially in the early

52
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.840
begin and early phase, is an all-around tool.

53
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.380
For instance, one of the

54
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.220
most famous is Apollo. Obviously, you have a tool that is a database. But also, you can send

55
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.820
a bunch of emails, and you can do a bunch of outreach actions.

56
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.570
Then you have LinkedIn-only tools,

57
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.460
you have email-only tools, phone-only tools,

58
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.100
and multi-channel tools that don't have a database.

59
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.000
So perhaps in these tools, you can

60
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.960
build a side of actions so they go from LinkedIn

61
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.280
to email. But you need to feed in

62
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.940
your database within that. Then you

63
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.790
have databases. Okay, so

64
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.340
databases. You can either

65
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.260
find them online. So for instance,

66
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.160
you're selling to hotels. You can find hotel databases

67
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.230
online, or you can scrape them. Okay? So you can scrape

68
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.840
data in many ways. You remember we're talking about communities. We

69
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.540
were talking about posts. There are actually tools that

70
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.240
will allow you to scrape certain posts on

71
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.840
LinkedIn or other social media and do outreach

72
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.810
on these exact people. So you can be specifically on point

73
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.600
because they fit your ICP. Within

74
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.320
that case, you will need an

75
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.620
enrichment tool that kind of helps you out,

76
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.230
filtering what data is good, what data is not good. So if

77
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.110
the person from the company, and they will

78
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.970
also give you the email address and other

79
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.840
couple data that then you can plug in

80
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.760
into your multi-channel tool.

81
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.300
Okay, so these are the three types. Ultimately, you're

82
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.840
gonna need an outreach tool, and you're gonna need some sort

83
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.630
of database. If you're not going for an all-around solution, but again,

84
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.440
it depends on the go-to-market and the channels.

85
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.810
So I prepared a few

86
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.010
examples. So let's say that you are a small

87
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.100
SaaS, selling as a small

88
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.990
SaaS, loading to your clients. You need to

89
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.500
come on to the leads. You're going email only. You use Mailchimp or something like that. So you need integration. If you can manage

90
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.280
everything from there, it's bonus point: ease of

91
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.120
use. So then I can hire junior staff for it,

92
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.830
to be managed, or a

93
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.380
VA—a virtual assistant—and I

94
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.910
need to be rolling out constant solutions.

95
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.440
And I want to personalize the messages. So

96
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.370
this is the features that I need. So

97
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.080
listed from the variables. And

98
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.600
so if also there is a benefit

99
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.150
to buying domains and buying email addresses directly

100
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.950
from them, that is a huge bonus point. So I'm

101
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.030
going to be looking on the market

102
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.790
for something that fits these

103
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.510
exact needs. Okay. Instead,

104
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.820
if I'm selling B2B SaaS with high average

105
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.550
value of the leads, and I need much lower

106
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.700
volume but I need ease of use, I need some kind

107
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.970
of BDR and prospecting that is a little bit more

108
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.750
on point with leads included, I will go

109
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.160
for another round. A tool that can enhance productivity,

110
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.700
can go multi-channel, can be integrated, can have reporting,

111
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.280
and yeah, this is basically it.

112
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.480
Now, there is a cheat sheet here.

113
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.030
So there are a bunch of tools

114
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.720
that I already partnered with. So for

115
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.710
all-around, we have Apollo, Chrono, Lemlist. I'm giving

116
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.220
you a couple of automation tools that

117
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.170
are a little bit easier or a little bit

118
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.950
harder to learn. It really depends on your ICP

119
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.670
and how on-point you want to be, and

120
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.200
yeah, the stage of the startup. At

121
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.820
the beginning, I usually recommend doing

122
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.380
structured work. So even with the

123
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.100
support of the SaaS, but really do things manually, so you

124
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.200
can learn all along the way. The more you learn, the

125
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.820
more you'll find a tool that really fits you like a

126
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.480
glove. And

127
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.030
yeah, if you have questions about these tools, let me know. But also,

128
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.800
again, I'll be sharing my guide.

129
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.470
So the key takeaways for this are:

130
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.000
go-to-market rules the numbers. We'll see the

131
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.680
next lesson. The absolutely 100% rule

132
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.810
is scalable. So we need to think limits. Of course,

133
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.360
if we are handling cold calling, we need X

134
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.920
amount of people. Same for LinkedIn profiles, same

135
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.720
for email. Which you will need eventually: domains

136
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.490
and X amount of emails per domain. And yeah, so

137
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.580
you need to think about this when you're picking

138
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.520
up a tool. And of course, it has to be effective. I don't

139
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.240
know. Again, it depends on the stage you're at. So if

140
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.980
you really have a CRM or if you're really setting up automation,

141
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.600
tools like Make, Airtable, and then such. So of course, you need some kind

142
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.310
of flexibility from the perspective.

143
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.920
Okay, so next up, we will see the

144
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.770
operational side

145
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.600
of it. So tracking, APIs, and all the kind of stuff.

146
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.260
And yeah, see you next.
