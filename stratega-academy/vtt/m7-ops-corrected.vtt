00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.060
Here we go, guys. Welcome to

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.930
the very last module before we wrap

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.690
it up. So we came a long way.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.200
I think I was able to distill quite

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.740
a lot in short. I want to give you the

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.120
very last important bit: the one that really makes a difference.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.130
And this comes from growth marketing. So perhaps

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.700
I'll do something about that later on. But it's

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.470
a matter of testing and learning. And we'll see how

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.640
to make this effective in a really simple way.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.190
So I see campaigns, and then

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.920
I ask for a report. And the

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.360
report has inconsistency.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.990
I see perhaps reply rate on software,

15
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.240
but I don't have, let's say, a call approach.

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.120
Data are monitored, they're not

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
managed. It becomes hard to trust

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.710
the process because we fill

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
the KPIs, we fill the sales. But we don't

20
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.040
kind of get the learnings right.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.200
So how can we make this effective?

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.880
Remember by this time we have an offering. We

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
have an ICP or perhaps two, three different

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.200
ICPs that we might want to test in sequence.

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280
We have some content, we have some kind of copywriting

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.160
with flow and timing, and we know which channels

27
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.690
to use. So if I take back the example of

28
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.920
the SaaS, I can offer a POC, a course, free to walk away,

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.590
I can target the head of marketing or the marketing staff,

30
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.440
I can interview them, I have a landing page with the demo

31
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.080
and the flow and timing is medium: LinkedIn+

32
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.510
email, with a really soft copy on the validation

33
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.030
points. So in which direction am

34
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.650
I going to work? For the next

35
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.580
three months, my only goal

36
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.640
will be to find new clients.

37
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.240
How many? And that is

38
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.460
the goal. We're going to have a baseline

39
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.420
metric. So we start from five clients. We're going to target

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.120
24, with a target of 20 new clients. And the

41
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.170
leading indicators will be demos scheduled and positive

42
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.400
replies. Target date is

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.580
Q+1. So assuming

44
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.200
a 10% booking rate at a 15%

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.300
conversion rate, we need 1,340

46
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
prospects split: 55% go to tier

47
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.650
one, 30% go to tier two, 15% go to

48
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.920
tier three. So this is my only goal.

49
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.830
This is the only number that I take a look at.

50
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.940
And if not, it's noise. And this is your high

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.520
level operational set.

52
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.270
So you see: this is working, this is not working. Now you see what's

53
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.000
really working and what's not really working.

54
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.110
Of course, you're going to have breakdown by campaign, as it happens

55
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.830
for Facebook, Meta, and so on and so forth. So within this,

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.390
you will just have this breakdown. So I

57
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.940
actually have a campaign naming that

58
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.740
tells me exactly. Let's say, EMAIL,

59
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.610
1150, startups, seed,

60
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.320
and perhaps I had the marketing.

61
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.920
And every time that a campaign concludes, I come here,

62
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.080
I update this, and this tells me what happens.

63
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.990
Now, this is from the analytics standpoint. Then,

64
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.600
of course, we have to analyze it from a

65
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.240
qualitative point of view, meaning: why did

66
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.790
these people say no? Because

67
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.120
we might then want to tweak something.

68
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.040
So it's important that we test the variables

69
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.600
that we have, because we are unsure if the

70
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.170
offering is right. We're unsure if the channel is right, or

71
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.070
the channel mix is right. So as we were saying, we're going

72
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.650
to have a bunch of things. There are the ones that we

73
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.960
are most likely to succeed with because they're covering

74
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.760
the recovery point in the business, starting from the value proposition.

75
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.610
And then we test anything that we can

76
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.480
test, so we can find, again, the winner.

77
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.380
Every two weeks, you can

78
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.060
tweak something and you can find

79
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.340
out what's going on. Most importantly,

80
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.200
you can really make quick changes.

81
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.800
You can just change completely an angle of an email. So if you

82
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.610
get no reply, why are you not getting replies? So you

83
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.200
can just change direction, do something to

84
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.480
test, because that audience might be good.

85
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.310
It might be just not the right timing because perhaps

86
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.670
at that very moment, they are, I don't know, closing

87
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.360
the budgeting. It happened to us. So I had

88
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.190
to say I was validated. I spoke with the marketing

89
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.740
manager, and I asked him: "When is the right timing to get in touch with

90
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.450
you?" And what's your favorite channel? He told me: "You have to get in touch

91
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.190
at this exact date because we will prepare the budget for next

92
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.070
year in this exact frame." So

93
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.200
change it and ask.

94
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.850
Then: find top performers. Once you find the top performers, you can find ways to scale

95
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.440
your campaigns. Okay? If you get more advanced, you

96
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.540
can use Clay and other tools to automate. Or any then to automate

97
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.450
your flow. That's probably require

98
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.280
one or two people looking after it.

99
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.160
But yeah, extra tips here.

100
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.820
So please keep these. These

101
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.520
are super. I made super simple these dashboards.

102
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.310
So please keep them clean every two, three

103
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.160
weeks. Update them. Do always,

104
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.240
as we said: "Why did they say no?"

105
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.870
Because with a simple shift in copy, you might completely change

106
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.530
your campaign. It happened to me many times. And

107
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.680
yeah, as I mentioned in the example, seasonality and time-to-market.

108
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.510
As key takeaways: target structure, again.

109
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.160
Segmentation leads to scalability because

110
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.780
then you can scale. Let's say if you're taking sports, you can do one sport

111
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.860
at a time and just changing the variables or other

112
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.470
related segments. But once you've figured

113
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.440
out the channels and everything else, it's easy game. Or changing

114
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.950
to a country, perhaps you have to change, adapt the

115
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.630
tone, be more formal, and that kind of thing. But

116
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.180
it makes the job a lot easier because you tested

117
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.790
quite a lot of variables. Again, entry points. I've

118
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.560
been stressing this quite a lot. And that's

119
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.920
what works the most, at least for me.

120
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.520
And yeah: priorities. Priorities.

121
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.120
It can be frustrating from a start standpoint.

122
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.840
I know that.

123
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.440
But yeah, by prioritizing, you can speed

124
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.280
up the flow. And the more you get, let's say,

125
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.030
into a better flow, the better it is for you. So

126
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.360
yeah, I'll see you at the very, very,

127
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.960
very, very last video of the course.

128
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.480
Oh yeah, please do this.

129
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:32.000
Okay? [BLANK_AUDIO]
