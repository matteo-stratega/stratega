00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey everyone, welcome to the

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.630
very last module. Just to chat. So,

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.000
starting from a little recap: hopefully,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.630
now you have a clear offering with

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.170
clear ICPs, clear content that you

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.240
need to structure or improve, or propose

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.230
to your company to enhance your outbound

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.120
activities and can also enhance your inbound

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.790
marketing as well. With the flow and timing, or with

10
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.700
a better understanding of the flow and timing, or how you can test

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.910
it and how you can vary a copy angle. And hopefully,

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.670
I'll be adding a few more things about copywriting

13
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.220
soon, with a few extra templates. But this will give you

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.770
a lead generation strategy. So if you puzzle

15
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.440
everything up, you'll be able to get some

16
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.250
prospects, push them into a sequence, and

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.880
start off with the right flow. Or

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.650
if not, with the knowledge of what

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.880
to do next, if nothing is going your way.

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.420
Now I'm leaving you with just

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.970
one thing: a framework

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.920
from growth marketing that

23
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.430
also will lead to lead generation. You can kind of

24
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.290
try and test and be creative and do quite a lot

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.030
of things that will lead to unexpected

26
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.680
results. So I would encourage you

27
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.400
to treat this like experiments, where you can

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.640
gather ideas, you can decide what to prioritize,

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.590
so rank them, outline them. Meaning: talking to

30
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.780
the marketing department or being yourself the marketing

31
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.000
and growth person, so building the assets your company needs.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.620
Work, work, work. So run the campaigns

33
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.220
and run the changes that you need to do in order

34
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.510
for them to work or to have a massive learning,

35
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.840
which you can then study at the very last section

36
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.560
with qualitative and quantitative analysis.

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.110
So thank you, thank you

38
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.660
very much for being here

39
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
for this. I've been trying to distill the

40
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.220
very, very, very best of me that

41
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.800
applies to most categories

42
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.540
in this. Most likely, I will build

43
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.370
something extra very soon about growth marketing or about

44
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.900
the sales playbook. We'll see. To know

45
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.820
that if you can provide me feedback or suggestions

46
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.460
or if you'd like to have some extra videos, I've built

47
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.020
some content in the past. I just need to put it in place.

48
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.760
So if you help me understand what you

49
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.440
need, this may be the place. I don't know.

50
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.480
I hope this is going to help quite

51
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.240
a lot of people. And so if you liked it,

52
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.900
feel free to share it, okay? Thank

53
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.360
you very much. Bye! (Laughs)
