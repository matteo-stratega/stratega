00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.810
Hello, hello, hello everyone.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.480
Welcome, welcome, welcome here. I'm glad

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.090
to see you. My name is Matteo Lombardi, for

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.800
those who don't know me. I've been running this agency, Stratega,

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.630
for six years, and then I became a founder

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.690
within this to explore. I generated

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.510
quite a few opportunities. But coming from

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.400
a marketing perspective, I applied

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.390
some growth marketing processes

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
to sales lead generation, specifically

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.320
for B2B tech businesses and startups. So that

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.040
is basically what we're going to see.

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.840
And we're going to see this because

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
outreach is overwhelming, confusing, high pressure when you're

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.070
starting, and you don't know where you're going.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.860
There are a lot of tools, a lot of things, and you're doing

17
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.480
a lot of stuff, and it's all messy. So we'll

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.130
fix that. Or when you're starting and you

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.730
need a little bit of scaling, you need to understand which direction

20
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.400
to scale, right? We will cover that as well. So for you

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.700
that are a little bit more advanced, and same for

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.210
environments where we're already at the C

23
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.180
stage or a little bit above. So you

24
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.470
need to implement and over-perform,

25
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.400
or find a way to generate more.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.960
So we'll cover all these aspects because everything that

27
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.760
you will find here is a framework, meaning that you can

28
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.400
apply this framework forever and ever, as long

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.060
as you refresh it, as long as you test it, as

30
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.400
we will see. And yeah, you can basically

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.020
use this in each and every stage of your startup

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.590
or your business. To start with a lead generation

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.560
system, because we will cover quite a few things

34
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.660
and it will be in videos of less than 10 minutes.

35
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170
A lot of them are really short. So we are

36
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.780
condensing, we are doing this together,

37
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
so meaning that I will give you homeworks,

38
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.290
I will expect deliverables. This includes all the frameworks.

39
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.830
So we will be filling everything together. I'll present you the

40
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.470
framework, we will see with an example at

41
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.320
the beginning, an easy one, and at the end,

42
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.660
a really tough one. The topics that we'll be covering:

43
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.590
offering. So we'll start with building

44
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.400
an offering or how to tweak an offering to make

45
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.200
it more appealing. We'll see the ICP in a lot

46
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.740
of detail. We'll see what we do from the

47
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.420
content perspective in terms of assets. Not only

48
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.030
copywriting for campaigns, but also how we

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.910
need to set up a landing page or what kind

50
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.090
of content the ICP from the buying committee

51
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.280
needs to have before they make a decision.

52
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.510
Also, we'll talk briefly about tools, so how to implement

53
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.150
this whole thing for your business. And from

54
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.130
the operational standpoint, how to keep it clean

55
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.060
and how to have some sort of ops system that

56
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.640
we update every two to three weeks with some sort

57
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.230
of analysis. And we figure out what is going well and what

58
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.830
is not going well. We change things and

59
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.400
we see what works best. This is for

60
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.340
a little bit of everyone: from sales leaders

61
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.080
that would like to work on optimization again,

62
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.850
so it's for founders, and founders like myself. So I would

63
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.080
appreciate this. And from the marketing standpoint, I know marketers

64
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.840
need to do quite a lot of sales stuff, and they also need

65
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.490
to build quite a lot of content. I believe this could be useful for

66
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.920
them as well, in terms of aligning with a good market strategy

67
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.550
also because they can effectively go

68
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.400
and implement these tools. The sales

69
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.970
experts need to help, especially for content management

70
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.680
or automations. Now, importantly,

71
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.540
we're going to fail a lot. I mean, I have really

72
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.400
good KPIs, but this is because I can

73
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.530
try to put failure in a grid. So we'll

74
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.370
see how to fail. And we know that we're

75
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.880
going to start this way, we will not get an answer.

76
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.070
The thing is how we puzzle up everything

77
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.670
the right way so we can make learning effective. So next

78
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.180
time we go, we hit, and we hit it out. So

79
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.050
it might take a week, it might take two to three months, it might

80
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.900
take six months. It depends how big the account is. So we'll

81
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.440
deep dive also into that. And yeah, we'll

82
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.010
make it effective so we can scale our campaigns

83
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.800
because we want to have some sort of prediction

84
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400
on what's going to happen. But also, we need to scale it, but

85
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.290
we need to scale in a certain way because, of course,

86
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.450
you will need to be hands-on with some aspects

87
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.110
of this thing. And this effort will ultimately

88
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.840
save a lot of time in the future because, once you find

89
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.590
out what actually works, you have a good

90
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.140
market structure that is, yeah, you

91
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.280
can automate it or implement further

92
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.210
automation to make the job really easy

93
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.060
for you. So that's it. I hope you're ready

94
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.680
for this. It's going to be quite a lot of things because

95
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.330
again, I'm giving you all the frameworks that I used to generate these

96
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.440
results. So I'll see you next time.

97
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.140
Looking forward to beginning. [BEEPING]
