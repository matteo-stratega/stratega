00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.590
Hello everyone. Welcome to chapter

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.270
5: Copywriting. Now.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.000
This is one of my favorites because I will

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.600
try to challenge you deeply on this.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.550
So let's see the mistakes that we usually see

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.180
when trying to do lead generation. So

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.090
people usually sound really salesy:

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.680
"We do this and this. We provide you this. Would

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.520
you..." blah, blah, blah. Okay, it's annoying.

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.340
Or sometimes you see novels, but

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.960
the end thing is that they all sound a little bit

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.590
spammy, unpersonalized, and yeah, it

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.430
just doesn't work. So I want you to make

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.280
a deal with me: would you be up for it, just

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.440
for two weeks? So we'll try to take a different approach.

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.670
We will try to validate something instead

17
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.440
of trying to sell it. Okay? I'll make

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.040
a tough example on a SaaS, and we'll see how we

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.550
can take this. But I would like you to test for your next

20
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.680
campaign validating. And we'll see what that means in a second.

21
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.510
Check my hand. Okay, let's

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.040
go. So I write my goal from my perspective:

23
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.700
action. So what I want to do

24
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.740
with my CEO? I want to understand

25
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.320
if they're trying to build a

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.700
sales playbook, to build a lead generation strategy,

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.760
to build the go-to-market strategy, so I can help

28
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.540
them. And I can try ways to try

29
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.860
to find ways to ask them these specific

30
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.280
questions without being salesy.

31
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.840
Because if I'm salesy, they will never do

32
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.410
me a referral. But if I ask something

33
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.380
kindly and nicely, then I could always

34
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.420
say, "Well, do you know anybody who needs

35
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.940
this?" Okay. As

36
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.550
simple as

37
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.240
that.

38
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.960
We might start up like we made the first two deals like this.

39
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.950
Okay. So no sales understanding, trying

40
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.160
to build a relationship. And there is no "we do this,

41
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.200
we do this, we do this, we do this." It's about the

42
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.640
prospect always. 100% of the time.

43
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.480
Okay. Now we're going to see a couple

44
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.480
of frameworks, as per usual. So channels, obviously,

45
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.120
that's super important. The copywriting frameworks. If

46
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.920
you don't know, there are a lot of frameworks like AIDA, PAS,

47
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.660
4PS. They're all different. So it's ways of

48
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.690
explaining something and leading the prospect on the path of the journey that the

49
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.400
user is supposed to make. And we'll

50
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.250
see the timeline, obviously by tier. Now, coming to the

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.790
channel: email. It's really important to be able to cut the noise.

52
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
So we have to be different. LinkedIn and communities:

53
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.280
always relationship first. And phone: really clear,

54
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.430
quick, and structured. Now, about how to test

55
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.970
the channel, I would recommend you, like, every

56
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.130
two to four weeks, to try to change channels,

57
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.720
starting with what you design with the AIDA.

58
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.390
So with my CEO, I would start with LinkedIn first, and email

59
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.920
second. But then I could also try LinkedIn

60
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.720
only, or email only, or both

61
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.300
of them. So then I know what and how

62
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.910
I can scale stuff, because email is more

63
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.770
scalable, of course, than LinkedIn. Phone is less

64
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.380
scalable. So we need to find

65
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.270
the best way to do it and to

66
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.900
find a winning formula. So it's a process

67
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.180
that is always ongoing. Now, as an example of a framework,

68
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.240
we have AIDA. So we need to attract the user first,

69
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.890
stimulate the interest, then spark desire, and ask

70
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.440
them to perform an action. And to do this, we're

71
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.560
going to be using LinkedIn and email.

72
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.430
Now, something really personal. This is my personal

73
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.250
flow. What I actually do is sit down and

74
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.820
write this stuff by hand before I

75
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.430
design each campaign. And everything

76
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.160
pretty much is a recap, so it helps me

77
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.770
bring back the memories. Or the

78
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.410
most important thing to me is this last question:

79
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.010
"What would you tell this person if you were

80
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.680
to meet at a bar during an industry

81
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.360
event?" So this is usually my opening

82
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.400
because I want to start a conversation.

83
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.170
Now we are going to make a different

84
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.810
example. So we are targeting wealth,

85
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.560
we are a SaaS, we do AI research. So it's a little

86
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.420
bit more complicated than the free

87
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.540
school for founders. And we're going

88
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.290
to use the customer interview as

89
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.880
a hook. The goal is for us to validate if

90
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.200
they do market research with AI. And the target is wealth.

91
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.710
So the first thing I'll try is to get the interview. Then

92
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.390
I'll try to build trust and showcase the benefit. Then

93
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.000
I'll interview follow up, and then I'll make the offer. And

94
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.840
I'll use LinkedIn and email as channels.

95
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.620
So writing everything down, I'm targeting the

96
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.280
marketing manager. My ICP needs more research

97
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.250
data. I interviewed them together. Their knowledge: if they're really

98
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.960
using it, how they're benefiting from this.

99
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.780
I can offer them a POC at cost if they want

100
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.950
to try the platform. These are the outcomes.

101
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.200
And the question I would ask: "Is AI disrupting

102
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.890
the industry? What is your take

103
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.640
on that?" And I can also, within

104
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.170
this feed, give them a demo of the

105
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.770
platform somehow. So if I were to write this

106
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.340
person, the first message would be about qualification

107
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.200
and noting: "You've been in marketing for quite a few years.

108
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.250
Must have been a rally, especially now that AI kicked

109
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.760
in and has changed

110
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.170
the way we do market research. Actually,

111
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.450
I reached out about an interview.

112
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.280
Mind if I share a bit more? So I'm

113
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.290
not being too pushy. Then moving

114
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.920
to step two: I would try to build trust

115
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.760
and spark interest, saying: "Well, I'm

116
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.780
a researcher. This is my job title, which of course

117
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.120
is relevant. And we work on AI market research,

118
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.870
and we are running this kind of

119
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.020
interview because it's relevant, because

120
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.600
AI disrupted the way we do this.

121
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.440
Now we can achieve this and that.

122
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.320
Would you be willing to take an interview on this?

123
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.980
Are you already working with AI? Are you

124
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.000
already marketing? Are you seeing these benefits?"

125
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.870
Because I'm showcasing this, and I also want to see

126
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.360
if this person is already using one of my competitors,

127
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.040
because if not, okay, that's one really

128
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.800
big point for us. Then I'll write the email

129
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.440
in case they don't get back to me on LinkedIn.

130
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.600
We are wrapping up the interviews, so I can add urgency:

131
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.440
"We are wrapping up the interviews since

132
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.270
AI tools disrupt interviews and marketing

133
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.120
experts are saying this to achieve this.

134
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.750
If you're willing to share your expertise, we'd love to have you join the

135
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.590
other 25 experts." So we are adding a little

136
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.290
bit of social proof. The last email:

137
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.920
again, we didn't sell anything because we don't know

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.680
if we are the right solution for them

139
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.820
and if this is the right prospect

140
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.460
for us. "Today is the last shot to be part

141
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.370
of the study. Perhaps you are not already

142
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.660
into AI. So we can use something that triggers

143
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.960
them emotionally, because if not,

144
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.600
this is the thing: 'Did you check out

145
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.220
our website? There is a video right there.' So this doesn't

146
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.890
embarrass anyone. They can take a look. It's quick. They

147
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.670
can just type a link, so we can get a user

148
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.640
on our site, and that is the exact beginning

149
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.910
of the journey that we planned,

150
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.760
from awareness to conversion.

151
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.730
Moving on: timeline and triggering. Of course,

152
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.390
the same applies to triggers. Some of them are

153
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.160
quicker, some of them are not. We made the hardest one.

154
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.920
I made a lot of examples on the first and on the second.

155
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.600
We made the hardest one because that is

156
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.280
something that needs to be a little bit

157
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.850
refined first. Key takeaways: validate,

158
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.730
don't sell. You shook my hand. Don't forget about

159
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.330
that. It's always about them. And you can be

160
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.320
very creative here because a lot happens.

161
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.850
A lot of people have a lot of interest, and of course, they have a

162
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.560
lot of goals. So if you understand if these are the goals, you

163
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.160
can be creative, and you can build a lot of things. And

164
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.850
the last thing I want to tell you is test, test, test. Try to change

165
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.410
angles. Try to, if you're doing cold email, spin syntax

166
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.050
or liquid syntax, where you can change the sentences

167
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.670
according to stuff. Take a look into it

168
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.060
and test a lot of things. They'll be testing.

169
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.080
You probably know. If not, you can ask.

170
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.860
I will see you next time with tools

171
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:13.440
and your turn. [BLANK_AUDIO]
