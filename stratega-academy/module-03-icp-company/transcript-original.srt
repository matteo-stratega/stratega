1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,540
Alright guys, welcome to module 2,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,100
ICP. I'll split this into two parts. You're going

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,630
to see the company side of it and the people side of

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,400
it in the module 3. I don't want to dip it dive because

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,000
it's really important because I see most people

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
selling everyone and it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,300
They try to sell me the thing but oh yeah, but I selected

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,930
software development companies 51 to

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,000
200 and I sent them my best offer but I didn't get replaced.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Guys, you need to be relevant today.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're bumped constantly with ads. We are bumped constantly with everything

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,710
and sales is another channel that is also an annoying

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,230
one. Unless you decide to

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,250
make things a little bit different,

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,000
you're not going to cut through the noise. It's impossible.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,690
We need to take all this and we need to take all this

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,390
now because this happens both to pre-seed startups but also to people

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,000
that already have a sales process that is probably working

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,050
than the one that the course is proposing. But sometimes

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,610
the campaigns go up and down so you need to refresh

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,300
your point of view or you need to find something different. We'll

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,000
see how to find something different here from the company perspective.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,530
We're going to use three frameworks. The one is the demographics, the second one

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,270
is triggers and the third one is tiering. With

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,950
the first one, we're going to see all the company's data that we

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,600
need. The triggers are going to identify something that can help be more

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,660
relevant and with the third one, we will avoid getting

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,340
out of our minds because it's taking too long

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,210
just to sell one single thing. We'll see the concept

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,980
of tiering. Now, before we even begin with

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,850
the first framework, remember you're never

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,730
selling to one single person. You're going to have a champion

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,310
that is the person that is going to push you. You're going to have the

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,050
decision maker that will sign the agreement. It could be the

35
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,610
same as the champion. But you might also have an influencer, somebody

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,630
that you can also get in touch with. You might have a person

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,360
that is reluctant to do anything. So you need to

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,940
tackle that when you sell. And you have

39
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,760
a gatekeeper, so somebody that might actually can

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,290
get the food and the door for

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,990
you. It's really important that you understand this

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,610
because we have to convey this in copyrighted messaging and content later

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,440
on. Now, without further ado, filmographics. What

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to see is something like this.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,270
I want to have enough detailed

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,000
data but not too small.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,590
Meaning that I'm going into, say, as

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,130
a navigator Apollo and I'm trying to

49
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,650
find startups, to five millions with that

50
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,640
company headcount. And I try to narrow it down

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,000
when I have a batch of two to five thousand.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,630
So then I can make the campaign scalable. But if

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,360
I go below two thousand, that

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,990
might be too small. So I might go up. So this is

55
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,000
a flexible scheme so you can add things

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,400
or you can remove things. But Bullpark five thousand,

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,040
three five thousand, it's good range for scaling

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,600
campaigns. So that is really important

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,300
for you to do there and how to do it

60
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,850
right. Then triggers. We might find

61
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,400
out that there are some triggers, some updates that are

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,160
really good. So some of them could be just

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,340
related to the timeline that they have. Or about

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,000
social media updates that they publish.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So if they are preparing an event, I can get in touch because

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,770
I can send my software for the event. So if I'm

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,360
going to a conference, that's another

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,000
way of doing an outbound based on triggers.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So you cannot just manage triggers there and they will look like this.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,700
So if there is any useful update, they are

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,320
hiring a new sales member or they are

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,910
closing more clients. Or you don't see

73
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,000
that they are closing clients. There could be some kind of trigger.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So please identify them and make good use of them.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,590
Whether you are in the first sales part or whether you're in

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,480
the most advanced bit where you're doing more

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,240
BDR kind of job. This is going to be really

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,000
helpful for you. Then tiering.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,660
Without going nuts, you can sell to anybody

80
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,250
at the same time or with the same timeline. You

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,890
always want to go for Wales, but unless you know how

82
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,400
to sell them, unless you know the pain points of the

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,000
blocker in the buying committee, because they might block you there,

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you're going to waste a lot of time in a sales cycle.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,860
So what we have to do is we have to keep in mind that

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,520
there are some deals that will be fast and this will

87
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,340
be medium. Some deals will be long. So we need to build the outbound

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,480
campaigns within this ratio and within your company's

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,000
goals so we can avoid losing our mind

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,920
and manage the sales pipeline and the

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,700
campaigns properly. For us,

92
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,320
like for the example, it would be a pre-seed startup that

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,090
would be the easy sale, but the seed startup might take long because they have

94
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,880
more people, longer adoption, more proof needed, better social

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,720
proof and the Wales that I know is going to take three months. I will

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,340
decide when to reach out and I can move

97
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,070
on with that. Now the key takeaways are the ones

98
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,000
in my voice. Target structure, okay.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,550
Segmentation leads to scalability because when we find out

100
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,060
what works for that specific segment, we can then scale

101
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,160
the campaigns. Entry points will help you cut through

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,160
the noise. So really key and we'll see later on also

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,420
with the personal standpoint how to do it with communities

104
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,000
and other channels and target priorities.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,700
So you can balance it out so you can start reaching out to Wales while

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,460
you try to close fast deals with postpone the intermediate because

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,130
it also depends on the tools and the amount

108
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,770
of time you have for this. But we'll see also

109
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,280
that later on. If you have any questions, shout out. Otherwise,

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll see you in a minute or two. It's now your turn.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,000
