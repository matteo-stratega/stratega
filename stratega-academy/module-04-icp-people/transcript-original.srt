1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,740
Hey guys, welcome to module 3.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,630
IACP will deep dive into the customer profile

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,000
this time. We'll see all the ins and outs and offsets.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,740
Now, before we start, let's start again with the mistakes because

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,260
stop selling everyone is a concept that

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,390
I want to endorse each and every time because

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,370
the more bigger the list and the more

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,990
variable will be your offering

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,000
and your copywriting, the less learnings,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
the less meaningful learnings we can make. So if I

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,130
have a set amount of variables like

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,880
any problem in math problem, you can change

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,720
the variables and make learnings and then find the winning path. So we

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,260
will do the exact same from the

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,000
perspective of the people.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,770
We are going to use the exact same frameworks that we used from

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,650
the previous chapter. So it's going to be really simple

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,000
from this standpoint. Now, from the demographic perspective,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
I want to have one bit on the side that will help

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,150
me set the tone with this person and the other thing will

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,660
help me, the thing on the right, so the job

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,220
title, location, company, site and so on. That will help me

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,000
find a set of people when I'm going to use a database

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,590
or when I'm going to do scraping or whatever that is that we will do

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,120
later. We can use them as filters. So

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,000
it's important that this stuff is kind of standardized from CS Navigator

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,510
or other tools that you might use to do a

28
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,290
little bit of market research. So it will look

29
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,990
something like this. So it's going to be important,

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,940
the company size and the first bit I know from the

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,680
company data, but also it's important for me the interest and the

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,350
touch point that she has on. We'll

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,010
see how to put that to use. The other bit that I want to

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,000
spend a little bit of time is the jobs to be done

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,110
because it's a really important framework

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,160
because it will help us frame the problem,

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,980
the outcome and the trigger in a much more

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,270
relevant way. Because I know, for example,

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,000
that the jobs to be done, my target CEO

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,730
of a pre-seed startup right now needs to improve the

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,520
sales team or has sales inconsistency or it

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,000
has a low growth rate. These are all triggers I can use in copyrighted.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,850
The same triggers I know want to

44
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,880
look for something. So I know what they're

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,550
looking for. And I know the

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,290
outcome. So let me see. If

47
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,100
they are able to sell more, this course really helps them

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,900
to sell more because of X, Y, Z, they'll be able to release stress

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,540
from inconsistency and focus on what matters

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,260
most. So my first intro could

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,000
be, A, do you feel your time could be optimized?

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, so that doesn't lead to sale, but it gives me an opening,

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but we'll see that later again. Then the four forces.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,550
This is important for the offering to

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,160
actually add extra spice to how bad our

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,000
customer problem situation is. How good is our solution?

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,690
What kind of anxiety they might have or how we can detach

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,240
from the status quo because a lot of people might be attached to the

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,350
status quo. They don't even want to change. So how

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,960
can we change that? So this is

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,670
another example. So a lot of stress for growth

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,230
and lack of time to create frameworks. That's all that we

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,000
ask funders struggle. So that's why we try to find templates

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,990
and they don't actually fit because templates are templates

65
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,000
and not frameworks. You can plug them in anywhere you want.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,620
That's why I'm giving you frameworks. So you can plug them in

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,610
anywhere you want, whether you're using Ocean, Gera, Trello,

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,440
whatever. How good is the solution? And then again,

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,000
anxiety and attachment to the status quo.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,590
All these bits will come later on at use. The

71
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,360
others are the touch points. So I know that Julia

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,870
listened to B2B Group podcast. She's part of the

73
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,560
female tech funders. And so that is, for instance,

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,080
a touch point that I can later on

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,790
use. So this is just a little

76
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,340
recap of our ICP. So I

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,000
have it clear. So I'll share the framework for you.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,780
So once you've done everything, you can fill this in and you're

79
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,720
going to have your personas right there. The other

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,300
thing are the touch points. So that's the

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,920
trigger spit. For instance, we said

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,750
that she likes podcasts. So we can send the first message

83
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,000
reaching out about the latest episode of XYZ podcast

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,540
that we know she follows. Or we could do an app bank campaign

85
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,680
using that exact podcast as a touch point. Hey,

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
have you ever listened to this podcast?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,580
They're talking about really interesting stuff about

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,190
sales. And then you can see if the prospects is

89
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,740
interested or not. So you can use a lot

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,400
of things like this. So accelerator pages

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,030
like LinkedIn pages. You can use meta communities to see

92
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,860
what people are talking about. You can use Slack communities

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,400
and you can gather these additional touch points and then

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,970
find the same people on LinkedIn. And then do a Taylor

95
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,610
campaign on exactly that. So this

96
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,000
is what will give you actually the superpowers.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,070
Okay, because you can make a lot of a lot of different

98
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,000
things from the perspective standpoint here.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,590
Now, do you remember mapping? Last time we talked

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,950
about tearing and mapping, the one thing

101
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,600
that I suggest you and recommend you for

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,680
each and every people, especially the bigger sales

103
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,000
you do is to not only to map out the buying committee,

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but also to understand what are their concerns,

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,570
what are their goals, how they may

106
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,470
block you. So you can have content

107
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,000
later on that is preset and ready.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,820
Or when you already do the demo or when you already this

109
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,460
happened to me when you already made the first phone

110
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,290
call, they say, oh, no, but we don't put in

111
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,130
beverage service. I was reaching out to the basketball

112
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,000
teams and they were the first thing that they were saying to me,

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,950
oh, no, we don't manage the thing. And my answer

114
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,090
was preset. I know and I'm aware of it,

115
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,000
but I would like to have your endorsement before I go to the food and beverage manager.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,610
And then they were willing to talk to

117
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,850
me because they knew that I had an interest

118
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,710
in them. So these kind of things

119
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,440
will help you really understand

120
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,340
the buying committee and will help you prepare

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,160
stuff in advance so your sales cycle actually

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
doesn't get out of your hands.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,820
So the key takeaways of this module and I hope everything

124
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,580
was clear because we covered a lot of things. Again,

125
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,200
segmentation leads to scalability variables. If

126
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,160
you can find touch points, you can be relevant

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,000
and I again, please do a lot of it.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,780
Based a lot of your route bound on triggers and contents

129
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,330
and communities and stuff before you find your path

130
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,040
to scale and dynamic. So I see peace change

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,000
things change. Think about the shift of AI now.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Everything is changing with this. So everything is dynamic.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,730
So I see peace will change and buying committees

134
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,000
will change. So please update everything.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you don't want to do it every six months, every year,

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,050
let's say something like this. Okay. Now it's

137
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,730
your turn to pick tier design and SAP and try

138
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,400
to map out the company and stuff. And

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,000
I will see you for the next module.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ciao. [BLANK_AUDIO]
