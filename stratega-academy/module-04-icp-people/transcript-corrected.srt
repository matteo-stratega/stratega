1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,740
Hey guys, welcome to module 3.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,630
ICP. We'll deep dive into the customer profile

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,000
this time. We'll see all the ins and outs.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,740
Now, before we start, let's start again with the mistakes, because

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,260
stop selling to everyone. This is a concept that

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,390
I want to emphasize each and every time because

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,370
the bigger the list and the more

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,990
variable will be your offering,

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,000
and your copywriting, the less learnings,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
the less meaningful learnings we can make. So if I

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,130
have a set amount of variables, like

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,880
in a math problem, you can change

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,720
the variables and make learnings, and then find the winning path. So we

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,260
will do the exact same from the

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,000
perspective of the people.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,770
We are going to use the exact same frameworks that we used from

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,650
the previous chapter. So it's going to be really simple

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,000
from this standpoint. Now, from the demographic perspective,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
I want to have one bit on the side that will help

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,150
me set the tone with this person, and the other thing will

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,660
help me. The thing on the right, so the job

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,220
title, location, company, site, and so on. That will help me

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,000
find a set of people when I'm going to use a database

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,590
or when I'm going to do scraping, or whatever. We will do

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,120
later. We can use them as filters. So

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,000
it's important that this stuff is kind of standardized from Apollo or other tools that you might use to do a

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,510
little bit of market research. So it will look

28
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,290
something like this. So it's going to be important,

29
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,990
the company size, and the first bit I know from the

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,940
company data. But also it's important for me: the interest and the

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,680
touch point that she has. We'll

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,350
see how to put that to use. The other bit that I want to

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,010
spend a little bit of time on is the jobs to be done,

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,000
because it's a really important framework

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,110
because it will help us frame the problem,

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,160
the outcome, and the trigger in a much more

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,980
relevant way. Because I know, for example,

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,270
that the jobs to be done, my target CEO

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,000
of a pre-seed startup right now, needs to improve the

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,730
sales team, or has sales inconsistency, or it

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,520
has a low growth rate. These are all triggers I can use in copywriting.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,000
The same triggers I know, I want to

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,850
look for something. So I know what they're

44
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,880
looking for. And I know the

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,550
outcome. So let me see. If

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,290
they are able to sell more, this course really helps them

47
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,100
to sell more because of X, Y, Z. They'll be able to release stress

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,900
from inconsistency and focus on what matters

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,540
most. So my first intro could

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,260
be: "Do you feel your time could be optimized?"

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, so that doesn't lead to a sale, but it gives me an opening,

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,000
but we'll see that later. Then the four forces.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is important for the offering to

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,550
actually add extra spice to how bad our

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,160
customer's problem situation is. How good is our solution?

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,000
What kind of anxiety they might have, or how we can detach

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,690
them from the status quo, because a lot of people might be attached to the

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,240
status quo. They don't even want to change. So how

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,350
can we change that? So this is

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,960
another example. So a lot of stress for growth

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,670
and lack of time to create frameworks. That's all that

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,230
founders struggle with. So that's why we try to find templates,

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,000
and they don't actually fit because templates are templates,

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,990
and not frameworks. You can plug them in anywhere you want.

65
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,000
That's why I'm giving you frameworks. So you can plug them in

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,620
anywhere you want, whether you're using Asana, Jira, Trello,

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,610
whatever. How good is the solution? And then again,

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,440
anxiety and attachment to the status quo.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,000
All these bits will come later on at use. The

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,590
others are the touch points. So I know that Julia

71
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,360
listened to B2B Growth podcast. She's part of the

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,870
Female Tech Founders. And so that is, for instance,

73
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,560
a touch point that I can later on

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,080
use. So this is just a little

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,790
recap of our ICP. So I

76
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,340
have it clear. So I'll share the framework for you.

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,000
So once you've done everything, you can fill this in, and you're

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,780
going to have your personas right there. The other

79
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,720
thing are the touch points. So that's the

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,300
trigger split. For instance, we said

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,920
that she likes podcasts. So we can send the first message

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,750
reaching out about the latest episode of XYZ podcast

83
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,000
that we know she follows. Or we could do an app bank campaign

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,540
using that exact podcast as a touch point. Hey,

85
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,680
have you ever listened to this podcast?

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
They're talking about really interesting stuff about

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,580
sales. And then you can see if the prospect is

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,190
interested or not. So you can use a lot

89
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,740
of things like this. Accelerator pages

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,400
like LinkedIn pages. You can use Meta communities to see

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,030
what people are talking about. You can use Slack communities,

92
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,860
and you can gather these additional touch points, and then

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,400
find the same people on LinkedIn. And then do a targeted

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,970
campaign on exactly that. So this

95
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,610
is what will give you actually the superpowers.

96
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, because you can make a lot of different

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,070
things from the perspective standpoint here.

98
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,000
Now, do you remember mapping? Last time we talked

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,590
about tiering and mapping. The one thing

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,950
that I suggest and recommend for you,

101
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,600
for each and every person, especially the bigger deals

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,680
you do, is to not only map out the buying committee,

103
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,000
but also to understand what are their concerns,

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
what are their goals, and how they may

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,570
block you. So you can have content

106
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,470
later on that is preset and ready.

107
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,000
Or when you already do the demo, or when this

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,820
happened to me, when you already made the first phone

109
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,460
call, they say, "Oh no, but we don't manage the thing."

110
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,290
I was reaching out to the basketball

111
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,130
teams, and they were the first thing that they were saying to me:

112
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,000
"Oh no, we don't manage the thing." And my answer

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,950
was preset. I know, and I'm aware of it,

114
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,090
but I would like to have your endorsement before I go to the food and beverage manager."

115
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,000
And then they were willing to talk to

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,610
me because they knew that I had an interest

117
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,850
in them. So these kinds of things

118
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,710
will help you really understand

119
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,440
the buying committee and will help you prepare

120
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,340
stuff in advance, so your sales cycle actually

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,160
doesn't get out of your hands.

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
So the key takeaways of this module, and I hope everything

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,820
was clear, because we covered a lot of things. Again,

124
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,580
segmentation leads to scalability. Variables. If

125
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,200
you can find touch points, you can be relevant.

126
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,160
And again, please do a lot of it.

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Base a lot of your outbound on triggers and content

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,780
and communities and stuff before you find your path

129
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,330
to scale. And dynamic. So I see people changing

130
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,040
things change. Think about the shift of AI now.

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,000
Everything is changing with this. So everything is dynamic.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I see people will change, and buying committees

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,730
will change. So please update everything.

134
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,000
If you don't want to do it every six months, every year,

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
let's say something like this. Okay. Now it's

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,050
your turn. Pick a tier, design, and SAP, and try

137
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,730
to map out the company and stuff. And

138
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,400
I will see you for the next module.

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Ciao. [BLANK_AUDIO]
