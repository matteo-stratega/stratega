KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. FRAMEWORK ACCURACY
   All major frameworks from slides are accurately captured in transcripts.
   Terminology variations (lowercase vs uppercase) are acceptable and expected.

2. CRITICAL ERRORS FIXED
   - PASTOR → PAS (copywriting framework)
   - 4Ps → 4PS (copywriting framework)
   These corrections ensure students learn correct framework names.

3. COMPLETENESS
   All 7 slide decks cross-referenced successfully.
   No missing frameworks or major omissions identified.

4. CONCEPT CONSISTENCY
   Buying committee roles, awareness stages, trigger types, and KPI definitions
   all match slide content exactly.
