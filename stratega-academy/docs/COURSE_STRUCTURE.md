A more complete conversion framework:

3. **Proof:** Social proof, data, or examples
   - "Companies using this approach see 25% higher response rates"

4. **Push:** The call to action
   - "Let's explore if this works for your situation - 15 min call?"

Perfect for: Sales sequences, demo requests, free trial signup

#### Psychological Triggers
