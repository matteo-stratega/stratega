## SCRIPT FINALE

### **[0:00-0:08] HOOK - Pattern Interrupt**
*[Screen: graph view denso, zoom su un nodo "Q4 Strategy"]*
*[Click: esplode in 15 backlinks connessi]*

> "This is every client meeting I've had in 3 years. Watch."

*[Pausa 1 sec]*

> "That's not a folder. That's a brain."

---

### **[0:08-0:25] PAIN → PROMISE**

> "Your notes are dead ends. You write, you forget, you rewrite the same thing twice.
>
> Obsidian turns notes into a **network**. Every note can link to others. Your past work starts working for you."

*[Visual: split screen - left: folder structure, right: network che cresce]*

---

### **[0:25-0:50] DEMO 1 - Use Case Reale**

> "Example: I'm prepping a sales call."

*[Screen recording: typing veloce]*

> "Type `[[ICP]]` → pulls my Ideal Customer Profile.
> Type `[[competitor intel]]` → 6 research docs pop up.
> Type `[[pricing objections]]` → my entire playbook.
>
> **Zero search. Zero folders. Just connections.**"

---

### **[0:50-1:15] DEMO 2 - Graph View**

> "Now watch this: graph view."

*[Apri graph, zoom in/out]*

> "Every dot is a note. Lines are links.
>
> See that cluster? That's my entire content engine.
> This orphan? A forgotten idea I need to connect."

*[Hover su nodi, highlight clusters]*

> "Your brain works like this. Now your workspace does too."

---

### **[1:15-1:40] DEMO 3 - Plugin WOW**

> "And it gets better."

*[Quick cuts: 3-4 sec per plugin]*

> "**Dataview**: turns notes into databases"
*[Mostra table view di client pipeline]*

> "**Canvas**: visual brainstorming"
*[Mostra canvas con post-its linkati]*

> "**Excalidraw**: sketch your frameworks"
*[Mostra sales funnel disegnato]*

---

### **[1:40-2:00] PROOF - Credibility Shot**

> "I run my entire business in here.
> Client notes. Strategy docs. Content calendar. Financial planning.
>
> **847 notes. Zero folders. One brain.**"

*[Quick montage: dashboard, daily note, kanban]*

---

### **[2:00-2:10] CLOSER**

> "It's free. It's offline. Your files stay yours.
>
> If you're still using folders in 2025, you're leaving insight on the table."
