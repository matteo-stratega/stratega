## What Happened

### March - June 2024
- Strong start, good results
- Pipeline +120%

### July 2024 - Friction
- New CMO joined
- Different priorities (brand vs performance)
- Budget reallocated

### August 2024 - Churn
- Ended engagement
- Amicable, door open

## Lessons Learned
1. **Stakeholder risk:** New exec = reset relationship
2. **Document wins:** Had results but not packaged for new stakeholder
3. **Executive alignment:** Should have briefed CMO earlier

## Re-engagement Plan
- Q2 2025: Reach out to Lisa (moved to new company)
- Track new CMO's initiatives
- Case study ready if they return
