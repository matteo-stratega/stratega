## First Draft Script

> **Note:** This draft was roasted and improved. See [[TF Obsidian - Roast Notes]] for feedback and [[TF Obsidian - Final Script]] for final version.

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"Your notes are scattered across Notion, Google Docs, phone notes, and 47 open tabs? Today I'll show you the tool that changed how I organize all my work."

### [0:15-0:30] PAIN POINT
"The problem isn't taking notes. It's finding them. And more importantly: connecting them. Because the best ideas come when you link things that seemed separate."

### [0:30-0:45] INTRO TOOL
"Obsidian. It's free, works offline, and your files stay yours - they're simple text files on your computer. No mandatory cloud, no subscription."

### [0:45-1:15] FEATURE 1: Links
"First killer feature: internal links. Type two square brackets, the name of a note, and you've created a connection. Your brain works by association - now your notes do too."

### [1:15-1:45] FEATURE 2: Graph View
"Second: the graph. See all your notes and how they're connected. This isn't eye candy - it's how you discover patterns you didn't know you had."

### [1:45-2:15] FEATURE 3: Local + Plugin
"Third: it's yours and it expands. Local files, zero lock-in. And there are hundreds of community plugins - calendar, kanban, AI integration."

### [2:15-2:30] CTA
"Link in description. It's free, try it this weekend. Tool Friday, see you next week."

## Problems Identified

See [[TF Obsidian - Roast Notes]] for full analysis.

### Summary:
1. Hook too weak - "I'll show you" is death for short-form
2. Feature list format - not story-driven
3. No visual-first approach
4. CTA lacks urgency
