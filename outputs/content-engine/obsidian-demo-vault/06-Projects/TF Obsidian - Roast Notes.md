## AI Roast Summary

Reviewed [[TF Obsidian - Draft 1]] with content strategist agent.

### Verdict: 4/10 → 8.5/10 (with fixes)

## Key Critiques

### 1. Hook (3/10)
**Problem:** "Today I'll show you" = zero urgency, no pattern interrupt

**Fix:** Start with visual hook
> "This is every client meeting I've had in 3 years. Watch."
> [Graph view explodes]
> "That's not a folder. That's a brain."

### 2. Structure (5/10)
**Problem:** Feature list format doesn't work for short-form

**Fix:** Use case → Proof → Plugin wow
- Don't say "Feature 1" - show a real scenario
- Demo typing `[[ICP]]` and pulling related notes

### 3. Features Shown (6/10)
**Problem:** Links = invisible, abstract. Plugins = too technical.

**Fix:**
- Links → Show autocomplete + cascade of notes opening
- Graph → Give context ("see that cluster? That's my content engine")
- Plugins → Visual wow (Dataview table, Canvas board, Excalidraw sketch)

### 4. CTA (5/10)
**Problem:** "Try it this weekend" = weak

**Fix:** Create contrast + urgency
> "If you're still using folders in 2025, you're leaving insight on the table."

### 5. Tone (4/10)
**Problem:** Tutorial voice, not operator voice

**Fix:**
- Short sentences
- Confident, not explanatory
- "Watch this" not "I'll show you"

## Plugin Recommendations

| Plugin | Why | Visual |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Dataview | Notes → database | Table query result |
| Canvas | Infinite whiteboard | Strategy board |
| Excalidraw | Sketch in notes | Sales funnel drawing |

## Demo Content Strategy

**Don't use:** Generic examples (recipes, book notes)
**Do use:** Business brain (ICP, playbooks, competitor intel)

This builds credibility: "he actually runs his business in this"
