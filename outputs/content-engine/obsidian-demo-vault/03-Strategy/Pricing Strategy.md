# Pricing Strategy

## Current Tiers

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Target |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Starter | $5K/mo | Strategy + 2 channels | Early stage |
| Growth | $12K/mo | Full stack + team | Series A |
| Scale | $25K+/mo | Embedded + advisory | Series B+ |

## Pricing Philosophy
1. **Value-based:** Tied to revenue impact, not hours
2. **Transparent:** No hidden fees, clear scope
3. **Flexible:** Monthly, can scale up/down

## Objection Handling
See [[Pricing Objections]] for full scripts

### "Too expensive"
> "Compared to what? A full-time hire is $150K+. We deliver senior strategy at a fraction, with no recruiting risk."

### "Can we start smaller?"
> "Starter tier is designed exactly for that. $5K/mo, 2 channels, full strategy. Upgrade when ready."
