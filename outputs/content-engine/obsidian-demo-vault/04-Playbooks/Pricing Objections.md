# Pricing Objections

> Specific scripts for money-related pushback
> See also: [[Objection Handling]] for general objections

## The Framework

```
Acknowledge → Reframe → Quantify → Close
```

## Scripts

### "Too expensive compared to [cheaper option]"

**Acknowledge:**
> "You're right, we're not the cheapest."

**Reframe:**
> "But here's the thing - cheap growth advice is the most expensive mistake you can make. A bad strategy costs you months, not money."

**Quantify:**
> "What's a month of runway worth to you? $50K? $100K? We've seen companies burn 6 months on the wrong channel because they went cheap. Our fee pays for itself in time saved."

**Close:**
> "Would you rather save $3K/mo or save 3 months?"

---

### "Can we get a discount?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "I appreciate you asking directly."

**Reframe:**
> "Our pricing is tied to value delivered, not negotiation skills. If we discount for you, we'd have to discount for everyone - and that means cutting corners."

**Alternative:**
> "What I CAN do: start with Starter tier, prove ROI, then scale up. Or we can adjust scope if budget is truly fixed. What works better for you?"

---

### "Let me check with finance/my co-founder"

**Qualify:**
> "Of course. Help me understand - are they bought in on the need for growth support, or do we need to make that case first?"

**Enable:**
> "Happy to jump on a quick call with them, or I can send you a one-pager that addresses the ROI question directly. What would be more helpful?"

---

### "We need to see ROI first"

**Reframe:**
> "Totally fair. Let me flip it: what ROI would make this a no-brainer? 2x? 3x? Because I can show you exactly how we've delivered that for companies like yours."

**Proof:**
> "[[Client - Acme Corp]] - same stage, same budget concerns. 90 days: pipeline up 180%, CAC down 40%. Want the case study?"

---

## Price Anchoring Tactics

1. **Start high:** "Our Scale tier is $25K/mo for full embedded support..."
2. **Then:** "But based on what you've shared, Starter at $5K might be the right fit to start."
3. **Result:** $5K feels reasonable vs $25K anchor
