# Objection Handling

## Price Objections
See also: [[Pricing Objections]]

### "It's too expensive"
**Reframe:** Cost vs Investment

> "I hear you. Let me ask - what would it be worth to you to 2x your pipeline in 90 days? Our average client sees 3x ROI in the first quarter. The question isn't whether you can afford it - it's whether you can afford to wait."

### "We don't have the budget"
**Dig deeper:**

> "Help me understand - is it a timing issue, or is this not a priority right now? Because if growth is a priority but budget is tight, we have a Starter tier at $5K/mo that might be a fit."

## Timing Objections

### "Not the right time"
**Create urgency:**

> "Totally get it. Quick question - what would need to change for it to be the right time? Because often 'not now' becomes 'never' and your competitors aren't waiting."

### "We're too early"
**Reframe:**

> "Actually, early is the best time. Building growth systems now means you scale faster later. Our Starter clients often 3x before they need to upgrade."

## Competitor Objections

### "We're talking to GrowthCo"
**Differentiate:**

> "Great, they're solid. Here's the difference: they're enterprise, we're founder-led. You'll work directly with senior strategists, not junior account managers. And we're half the price with more flexibility."

### "We might hire in-house"
**Complement:**

> "Smart thinking. Here's what we see: even with a hire, you need strategy and training. We can do both - build the playbook and train your team. Then you have an asset that stays."

## Trust Objections

### "How do we know this will work?"
**Social proof:**

> "Fair question. Let me share what happened with [[Client - Acme Corp]] - same stage, same challenge. 90 days later, pipeline up 180%. Want me to connect you with their Head of Growth?"

### "We've tried agencies before"
**Differentiate:**

> "I get it - most agencies disappoint. We're not an agency. We're embedded operators. We've built growth teams at [X, Y, Z]. This isn't theory for us."
