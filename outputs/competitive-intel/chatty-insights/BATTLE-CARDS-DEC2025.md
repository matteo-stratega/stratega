## HIGH THREAT: BoltInsight

> [[BoltInsight-Analysis-191225|Full Report]]

### Who They Are (2 lines)
AI-moderated qualitative research platform. Strong SEO presence (2.4K monthly visits), mostly India traffic. Focus on scale + speed messaging.

### Their Weakness
| Weakness | How to exploit |
|----------|----------------|
| **India-heavy traffic** | "Their main audience isn't your market - they optimize for volume, not quality" |
| **No voice interviews** | "They do text and video, but voice interviews capture nuance differently" |
| **Generic positioning** | "They serve everyone - we specialize in FMCG, Fashion, Food" |

### Our Strength
| Strength | Messaging |
|----------|-----------|
| **Voice interviews** | "Consumers respond like WhatsApp voice notes - natural, detailed, authentic" |
| **Verbatim quotes** | "Automated verbatim quotes ready for your presentation deck" |
| **Industry focus** | "We understand Fashion/FMCG - not just the tech, but your business" |

### Objection Handling

**"BoltInsight ranks higher on Google"**
> "SEO rankings don't equal research quality. Our clients include Mondelez, Vodafone, Peroni - they chose us for results, not Google position."

**"BoltInsight seems more established"**
> "Established in what market? Check where their traffic comes from. We're purpose-built for European FMCG and Fashion brands."

### Killer Question
> "Can you see a BoltInsight case study from a Fashion or FMCG brand in Europe? We can show you Peroni, Mondelez..."

## HIGH THREAT: Outset.ai

> [[Outset-Analysis-191225|Full Report]]

### Who They Are (2 lines)
US-based AI-moderated research platform, likely VC-backed. Highest domain authority (DR 39), enterprise sales motion. Running paid ads for usability testing.

### Their Weakness
| Weakness | How to exploit |
|----------|----------------|
| **Enterprise complexity** | "They're built for Fortune 500 procurement cycles - 3-6 months to deploy" |
| **US-centric** | "Their team, their case studies, their focus - all US. Who's your local contact?" |
| **No voice emphasis** | "Text and video, but no native voice interview experience" |

### Our Strength
| Strength | Messaging |
|----------|-----------|
| **48h turnaround** | "Results in 48 hours, not 48 days. We move at startup speed." |
| **European focus** | "We understand GDPR, European consumer behavior, local languages" |
| **Founder access** | "You talk to Pietro, not a sales rep. We're invested in your success." |

### Objection Handling

**"Outset has more funding/resources"**
> "VC funding means they answer to investors, not customers. We reinvest everything in the product. Your project isn't a line item for a board meeting."

**"Outset has enterprise clients"**
> "Enterprise clients mean enterprise timelines. If you need insights this quarter, not next year, we're built for your speed."

**"Outset does emotional cue detection"**
> "Interesting feature. But does emotional cue detection actually change your business decisions? Voice interviews capture emotion naturally - no AI interpretation needed."

### Killer Question
> "What's the fastest Outset has ever delivered a project? We guarantee 48 hours."

## MEDIUM THREAT: Strella

> [[Strella-Analysis-191225|Full Report]]

### Who They Are (2 lines)
AI-powered customer research platform. Best try-before-buy experience (5-minute AI interview demo). Transparent pricing: $150-400/month subscription model.

### Their Weakness
| Weakness | How to exploit |
|----------|----------------|
| **Subscription model** | "Monthly subscription means paying even when you're not researching" |
| **Limited panel** | "3M panel vs our 4M+ - and ours is integrated, not third-party" |
| **No verbatim automation** | "You still have to pull quotes manually from transcripts" |

### Our Strength
| Strength | Messaging |
|----------|-----------|
| **Pay per project** | "Pay when you need research, not a monthly bill whether you use it or not" |
| **Automated outputs** | "Verbatim quotes, thematic analysis - ready for your stakeholder deck" |
| **Global panel** | "4M+ consumers, 50+ languages, one click away" |

### Objection Handling

**"Strella lets me try a 5-minute interview"**
> "Great - try it. Then ask them for a real project quote. We'll match or beat it, with faster delivery."

**"Strella is more transparent on pricing"**
> "Transparent pricing for a fixed subscription. But what if you only need research twice a year? Our per-project model is more cost-effective."

### Killer Question
> "How many projects do you run per year? Let's calculate: Strella subscription vs Chatty per-project."

## MEDIUM THREAT: ListenLabs

> [[ListenLabs-Analysis-191225|Full Report]]

### Who They Are (2 lines)
AI-powered customer research platform with clever lead magnet (AI Personality Test). Strong backlink profile (15K backlinks). Partial workflow coverage - interview + analysis, not full end-to-end.

### Their Weakness
| Weakness | How to exploit |
|----------|----------------|
| **Partial workflow** | "They do interview and analysis - no recruitment, no end-to-end" |
| **No global panel** | "You bring your own participants. We have 4M+ ready to go." |
| **Entertainment focus** | "Personality tests are fun. But is that the tool you want for serious research?" |

### Our Strength
| Strength | Messaging |
|----------|-----------|
| **Full workflow** | "Recruit, moderate, analyze, report - all in one platform" |
| **Global panel access** | "Don't have participants? We do. 4M+ consumers worldwide." |
| **Professional positioning** | "Built for enterprise research, not viral personality quizzes" |

### Objection Handling

**"ListenLabs has a cool personality test"**
> "Clever marketing. But when you need actual consumer insights for a product launch, do you want personality test tech or research-grade methodology?"

**"ListenLabs has more backlinks"**
> "Backlinks from personality test shares. Our backlinks are from Mondelez case studies and industry publications."

### Killer Question
> "Does ListenLabs provide participant recruitment? Or do you need to source your own?"

## LOW THREAT: Qualz.ai & Conveo.ai

### Quick Reference

| If prospect mentions... | Response |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Qualz.ai** | "Academic-focused platform with minimal market presence. Great for PhD research, not enterprise speed." |
| **Conveo.ai** | "Nordic startup with almost no search visibility. Ask them for case studies outside Scandinavia." |

---

## Chatty Positioning Statement

> "Chatty Insights is the only AI research platform with **voice-native interviews**, **automated verbatim quotes**, and **48-hour delivery** - built specifically for **FMCG, Fashion, and Food** brands. We're not a generic research tool adapted for your industry. We're built for consumer insights leaders who need depth at speed."

---

## Quick Counter Reference

| Competitor | Key Counter | Killer Question |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BoltInsight** | "India traffic, generic positioning" | "Show me a European Fashion case study" |
| **Outset** | "Enterprise complexity, US focus" | "Fastest delivery time?" |
| **Strella** | "Subscription model, no verbatim automation" | "Cost for 2 projects/year?" |
