We're opening early access to the first 50 people. Want in?

Let me know!

Matteo

Stiamo aprendo l'early access ai primi 50. Ti interessa dare un'occhiata?

Fammi sapere!

Matteo

### Week 4+: International Low-Engagement (If Needed)

**File:** `top_50_international_low_founder.csv`
**Expected conversion:** 4-8%

## 🧪 Key Hypotheses to Test

### H1: Message Volume Predicts Conversion
**Test:** Track conversion rates by message count buckets
- 0-5 messages
- 6-20 messages
- 21-50 messages
- 50+ messages

**Expected:** 50+ messages → 25-40% conversion
**Action:** If validated, prioritize 50+ msg contacts first in all future campaigns

---

### H2: Italian Market Is Underdeveloped
**Observation:** Only 2 warm Italian contacts out of 493
**Hypothesis:** Your 2023 activity was international-focused
**Opportunity:** Build more Italian relationships for better Stratega School fit
**Action:** Attend Italian startup events, engage more with Italian founders on LinkedIn

---

### H3: INCOMING Direction Converts 2x Better Than OUTGOING
**Test:** Track conversion by connection direction
**Expected:** INCOMING + messages → 30%+ conversion
**Expected:** OUTGOING + messages → 15% conversion
**Expected:** OUTGOING + no messages → 4% conversion
**Action:** Prioritize INCOMING contacts in future scoring

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### 1. **Your Network Has 27 Hidden Gems**
Out of 4,716 connections, only 27 have high engagement. These are your **true relationships**. Start there.

### 2. **Message Volume > Everything**
Contacts with 50+ messages = 1,000x more valuable than recent VC you never talked to.

### 3. **Italy Is Your Opportunity**
You have 493 Italian connections but only 2 warm relationships. Building the Italian network = strategic lever for Stratega School.

### 4. **Cold Campaigns Are Overrated in Your Data**
99.4% of your connections are low-engagement. Focus on the 0.6% first, then expand.

### 5. **V1.0 Would Have Failed**
Launching with V1.0 top 50 (cold VCs) → 4-6% conversion → €95-145 MRR (miss €490 goal).
Launching with V2.0 warm tier → 20-30% conversion → €280-455 MRR (hit €490 goal).
