## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Strategy 1: Dual-Track Campaign

**Track A: Customer Acquisition** (original V2.0 plan)
- Target: All 27 warm contacts
- Pitch: "Want early access to Stratega School?"
- Goal: €490 MRR

**Track B: Partnership Development** (NEW)
- Target: Top 10 promotional partners (Stef, Geni, Gabriele, Michael, Sofia, Stephen, Frank, Lorenzo, Olena, Arman)
- Pitch: "Want to offer Stratega School to YOUR audience?"
- Goal: 5-10x reach multiplier

**Why dual-track:**
- Some people are better as PARTNERS than CUSTOMERS
- Stef Curcio promoting you to 20K followers > Stef as €49/mo customer
- Can do BOTH (partner + customer)

---

### Strategy 2: Partnership Messaging Template

**For Influencers/Educators (Stef, Geni, Michael):**

```
Hey [Name],

Been thinking about you as I'm building Stratega School (systematization program for founders/growth operators).

Given what you teach on [their topic], I think there's a natural fit here.

Would you be open to exploring a partnership? Could be:
- Guest lecture/workshop in the school
- Affiliate program (20% commission)
- Co-branded content
- Or just cross-promote to each other's audiences

Totally informal – just wanted to float the idea. Thoughts?

Matteo
```

**For Community/Network Access (Sofia, Stephen, Peter):**

```
Hey [Name],

I'm launching Stratega School (systematization for founders/growth people) and I'm thinking about the [Soource community / IDA portfolio / Antler cohorts].

Would you be open to me offering a workshop or early access to [their community]?

I'm thinking it could be valuable for [specific benefit to their audience].

Happy to discuss how we could structure it. What do you think?

Matteo
```

**For SaaS/Product Partners (Frank, Olena, Alex, Arman):**

```
Hey [Name],

Been chatting with a few [Salesforge / Pagebuilder / etc.] users lately and realized there's overlap with what I'm building.

Stratega School = systematization program for growth operators. Lot of your users probably need this.

Any interest in exploring a partnership? Could be:
- Feature in newsletter
- Webinar
- Integration
- Or just share with relevant users

Let me know if you want to chat about it.

Matteo
```

## 💰 Expected Impact of Partnership Strategy

### Conservative (2-3 partnerships activated):

**Example: Stef Curcio promotes to audience**
- Reach: 20K followers
- Engagement rate: 2% (400 people see it)
- Conversion: 5% (20 signups)
- MRR impact: 20 × €49 = **€980**

**Example: Sofia promotes to Soource community**
- Reach: 2K community
- Engagement: 10% (200 see it)
- Conversion: 8% (16 signups)
- MRR impact: 16 × €49 = **€784**

**Total from 2 partners: €1,764 MRR** (3.6x your €490 goal!)

---

### Optimistic (5-7 partnerships activated):

**Influencers (Stef, Geni, Michael):** €1,470-2,450 MRR
**Communities (Sofia, Stephen, Peter):** €490-980 MRR
**SaaS partners (Frank, Olena, Alex):** €245-490 MRR

**Total: €2,205-3,920 MRR** (4.5-8x your goal!)

## 🔬 Additional Data That Would Help

### To refine promotional partner scoring:

1. **LinkedIn follower count**
   - Method: Manual check of profiles OR scrape using LinkedIn API/tools
   - Why: Determines reach potential

2. **Post frequency & engagement**
   - Method: Check last 10 posts, count likes/comments
   - Why: High engagement = higher promotional value

3. **Newsletter/email list indicators**
   - Method: Check profile/website for newsletter signup
   - Why: Email > LinkedIn for conversions

4. **Content creator signals**
   - Method: Search for their content (YouTube, podcast, blog)
   - Why: Multi-channel creators = more touchpoints

5. **Client roster size** (for consultants)
   - Method: Ask directly OR check testimonials/case studies
   - Why: More clients = more referral potential

6. **Community size** (for community managers)
   - Method: Ask OR check Slack/Discord member counts
   - Why: Bigger community = more reach

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Pure Partnership Play (High Risk, High Reward)

1. Contact top 5 promotional partners (Stef, Michael, Geni, Sofia, Gabriele)
2. Pitch partnership, NOT customer acquisition
3. If 2-3 say yes → 2,000-4,000 MRR (10x goal)
4. If all say no → back to customer acquisition

**Risk:** Partnerships take longer to close
**Reward:** Exponentially higher reach

---

### Option B: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Week 1:**
- **Customer pitch** → Giacomo, Lorenzo, Frank, Olena, Alex, Yannick (6 DMs)
- **Partnership pitch** → Stef, Michael (2 DMs)

**Week 2:**
- Analyze Week 1 results
- If partnership interest is high → prioritize partnerships
- If customer conversion is high → prioritize customers
- Launch 10 more of the winning approach

**Risk:** Split focus
**Reward:** Test both approaches, optimize based on data

**Bottom line:** You have 10 high-value promotional partners in your warm network. Activating just 2-3 could deliver 3-10x more reach than pure customer acquisition.

**The gem identification path is:**
1. ✅ Role/company keywords (done with current data)
2. ⚠️ LinkedIn follower count (need to scrape/manual check)
3. ⚠️ Content frequency (need to analyze profile activity)
4. ⚠️ Community/list size (need to research or ask)

**You can start NOW with current data. Follower counts would refine priority order but won't change WHO the gems are.**
