## ✍️ Draft DM Messages (Personalized)

### Template for Mega-Engaged (Giacomo, Stef, Michael)

```
Hey [Name],

Man, it's been a while since we last caught up! I've been working on something I think you'd really dig.

I'm launching Stratega School – basically a hands-on program for founders and growth people who want to systematize their go-to-market without burning cash on agencies or endless trial & error.

Given we've been talking about [specific topic from past convos] for ages, I thought you'd be the perfect person to check this out early.

Want to take a look? I'm giving the first 50 people access for free.

Let me know!

Matteo
```

**Personalization examples:**
- **Giacomo:** "Given we've been working together on PickEat..."
- **Stef:** "Given you're literally teaching people how to scale on LinkedIn..."
- **Michael:** "Given your GTM automation work at Clay..."

### Template for Highly Engaged Founders (Lorenzo, Frank, Alex, Olena, Yannick)

```
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! We've been connected for a while and I wanted to share something I'm building.

Stratega School – a systematization program for founders and growth operators. Think: ICP scoring, lead gen frameworks, GTM playbooks, all the stuff that usually takes 6-12 months of expensive mistakes to figure out.

We're opening early access to the first 50 people. Given your work on [their company/product], I thought you might find it valuable.

Want in?

Best,
Matteo
```

**Personalization examples:**
- **Lorenzo:** "given your work on DevOps consulting..."
- **Frank:** "given you're building Salesforge..."
- **Alex:** "given your work on Crono..."
- **Olena:** "given you're building Pagebuilder..."
- **Yannick:** "given you're co-founding CGL..."
