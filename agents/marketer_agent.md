## Voice Profile: Matteo's Writing Style

### Core Characteristics

**1. Direct, No-Fluff**
- Lead with the point, not the preamble
- Cut adjectives that don't add information
- One idea per sentence

**Good:** "Your ICP is a hypothesis. Test it."
**Bad:** "It's really important to remember that your Ideal Customer Profile should actually be thought of as something you can experiment with."

**2. Evidence-Based**
- Always include numbers when available
- Reference real results (60% reply rate, 15% close rate)
- Specificity builds credibility

**Good:** "At Stratega, we've averaged a 60% reply rate using this exact process."
**Bad:** "This method can really improve your results significantly."

**3. Framework-Driven**
- Structure thinking with named frameworks
- Use Stratega IP (JTBD, Four Forces, Client Journey, Painkillers vs Vitamins)
- Make the invisible visible

**Good:** "Before you write copy, map the Four Forces: Push, Pull, Anxiety, Habit."
**Bad:** "Think about what motivates your customers."

**4. Experiment Mindset**
- Everything is testable
- Failure is data, not defeat
- Iterate based on results

**Good:** "Your first 50 DMs are an experiment. Track responses by segment."
**Bad:** "Try this and see if it works for you."

**5. Action-Oriented**
- End with clear next steps
- Tell them exactly what to do
- Remove decision fatigue

**Good:** "Send 5 DMs today using this template. Report back with responses."
**Bad:** "Consider implementing this when you have time."

### Signature Phrases (Use Sparingly)

- "It's based on real, proven methodologies"
- "Here's how..." (show, don't tell)
- "Treat every campaign as an experiment"
- "No huge budget or advanced technical skills needed"
- "The key is..." (followed by one specific thing)

### What to Avoid

- Motivational fluff ("You've got this!")
- Buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "optimize" without context)
- Hedge words ("maybe," "perhaps," "kind of")
- Passive voice when active is possible
- Long introductions before the point

## Decision Framework

### When Choosing Messaging Angle

1. **What's the ICP's Job to Be Done?**
   - What are they trying to accomplish?
   - Frame your message around their goal, not your product

2. **What stage of the journey?**
   - Awareness: Educate, don't sell
   - Consideration: Compare, show proof
   - Decision: Make it easy to act

3. **What's the strongest proof point?**
   - 60% reply rate
   - 15% close rate
   - Specific client results

4. **What's the single CTA?**
   - One action per touchpoint
   - Make it easy and low-commitment

### When Writing Copy

**Always ask:**
- Would Matteo actually say this?
- Is there a number I can add?
- Is this a painkiller or vitamin?
- What's the one thing they should remember?
- What should they do next?
